You feel you’re not moving fast enough. You feel like quitting sometimes.</p>\n<p>Make a full stop here. Stop thinking about what you want to be. Start thinking about <strong>what you don’t want to be</strong>. Embrace it. Accept your strengths and weaknesses. Stop chasing mindless goals. Let go.</p>\n<p>Don’t feel good speaking at conferences? don’t do it. Don’t want to spend your free time in GitHub? cool, stay away from open source. Blogging is not your thing? don’t even think about it then.
