I’ve been asked this question a lot lately, specially since <a href=\"https://carlosroso.com/this-is-what-i-did-to-ace-the-toptal-interview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">I’m a big advocate</a> of <a href=\"https://www.toptal.com/#join-only-great-devs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toptal</a>. Leaving my nomad life behind was not an easy call, but I surely had my reasons.</p>\n<h1>It’s mainly about family</h1>\n<p>First things first. Amazon offered me a great relocation package to move to Madrid. <strong>The idea of living in Europe was very appealing for me and my wife — it was hard to decline</strong>. Not only this, we Colombians can apply for the Spanish citizenship after only 2 years of residence. I love Colombia, but an European passport opens a lot more doors.</p>\n<p>Madrid would also be the perfect spot for my <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/linaestadeviaje/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wife’s travel business</a>. She can reach any european city on a 60€ flight; that’s hard to rival.</p>\n<p>Here’s a pic of us enjoying the latest snowstorm at Madrid.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 662px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/4a9dc8f0b8fa4bf6c3d72fd917b07062/04784/snow.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100.60240963855422%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"snow-pic\"\n        title=\"snow-pic\"\n        src=\"/static/4a9dc8f0b8fa4bf6c3d72fd917b07062/be86f/snow.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4a9dc8f0b8fa4bf6c3d72fd917b07062/e72ac/snow.png 166w,\n/static/4a9dc8f0b8fa4bf6c3d72fd917b07062/62452/snow.png 331w,\n/static/4a9dc8f0b8fa4bf6c3d72fd917b07062/be86f/snow.png 662w,\n/static/4a9dc8f0b8fa4bf6c3d72fd917b07062/0f7d5/snow.png 993w,\n/static/4a9dc8f0b8fa4bf6c3d72fd917b07062/04784/snow.png 1174w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h1>It’s also for the teammates</h1>\n<p>I’d heard that engineers at <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fang-stocks-fb-amzn.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">FANGs</a> were brilliant. I was curious to work with them. I don’t consider myself in that league, though, but it was worth the shot. <strong>I wanted to work with people I admired, and Amazon offered that</strong>.</p>\n<h1>It’s mostly for my life purpose</h1>\n<p>I have a passion to mentor people and help them get cool jobs. My content online revolves around that topic and that’s what I’m known for. <strong>Working at Amazon gave me credibility to reach more people in the long term</strong>.</p>\n<h1>It’s about a dream come true</h1>\n<p><em>“I want to work for Microsoft”</em>, I used to tell mom when I was a child. It looked impossible at the time. I realized later in life that it was not about Microsoft; it was about working in the world’s top tech companies. Amazon allowed me to fulfill that dream — I connected the dots and closed the loop.</p>\n<h1>It’s all about code</h1>\n<p>SDEs (Software Engineers) at Amazon are all considered full stack. <strong>I was looking to get more exposure to Backend and Devops</strong>, but my background is in Frontend. Amazon was surely the right place to get this experience.</p>\n<h1>It’s not about money</h1>\n<p>Simply put, <strong>I’m making less than I was making at Toptal</strong>. The cost of living in Madrid is way higher than in Bogotá — I don’t have all the overhead I was used to. I can’t save and invest as much as before, but I live pretty well. On the bright side, though, my Amazon’s RSUs doubled in 2020. Money is ephemeral, a mere tool, not a big deal for me.</p>\n<div class=\"divider\"> </div>\n<h1>It’s not a goodbye</h1>\n<p>I live in the moment and I’m enjoying myself a lot these days. Working at Amazon is incredibly fun, but I’ll always be a digital nomad by heart. I loved to work from Bali some months, then write code in the Colombian coast, and then pick a plane for another adventure.</p>\n<p>Amazon is the best for me now and will be for the next few years. But, I know that <strong>someday I’ll be back on the road with my laptop, lost in a beach with my wife, and writing code all day long</strong> — just like the digital nomad that I used to be.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why I left Toptal for Amazon","description":"On leaving behind my digital nomad life","meta":null,"date":"February 08, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/why-i-left-toptal-for-amazon/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/setup-github-ssh-access-from-jenkins/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Setup Github SSH access from Jenkins"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/gh-pages-with-godaddy-domain/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Setup GitHub Pages with GoDaddy domain"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
