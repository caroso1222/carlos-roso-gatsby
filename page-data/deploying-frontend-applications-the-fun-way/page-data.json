In the following paragraphs I will outline my thought process and explain how my deployment pipeline works. I won’t go deep into technical details but will instead put up some useful links for your further research.</p>\n<h1>The problem</h1>\n<p>Simple: I developed a <a href=\"https://github.com/caroso1222/ast-viewer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">TypeScript AST interactive viewer</a> in Angular and I wanted to deploy it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2876/1*pVi41c1uXwh4PYd3S0YC3g.gif\" alt=\"TypeScript AST Interactive Viewer\"><em><a href=\"https://ast.carlosroso.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">TypeScript AST Interactive Viewer</a></em></p>\n<p>*Bu… but, why not use Firebase, Google Engine, vanilla FTP, GH pages? you know, like “one-click deploys” duh —*you may ask. All those tools work great, but most of them are either too expensive or just felt too magical (nothing tops “gcloud app deploy”) and <strong>are not that fun to learn</strong>! I wanted to understand, automate and have full control of the whole deployment process. I wanted a challenge, I wanted to learn, I wanted to have fun (hell I’m inspired).</p>\n<h2>What it all comes down to</h2>\n<p>I set up my own challenge which looked like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>I want to push code and have it deployed automatically — aka Continuous Delivery.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I want to pay a cheap hosting service</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s draw these non-functional requirements in a black box diagram:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*imyfQi6O0bSnkBWmBMi6Iw.png\" alt=\"Problem illustration. From GitHub to Live App. Icon: magic by ✦ Shmidt Sergey ✦ from the Noun Project\"><em>Problem illustration. From GitHub to Live App. Icon: magic by ✦ Shmidt Sergey ✦ from the Noun Project</em></p>\n<h1>Unraveling the Magic box</h1>\n<p>I’ll divide this chapter into three parts. Each part will reveal one small portion of my Magic box:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>From GitHub to Magic</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Developing the Magic</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>From Magic to Live App</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h2>1. From GitHub to Magic</h2>\n<p>Push code, sit and relax, refresh live app, profit. That’s all I wanted.</p>\n<h3>Choosing my VPS (Virtual Private Server)</h3>\n<p>The first step was then to set up a server which could grab my code from GitHub and execute a series of commands (<em>npm i &#x26;&#x26; npm run build</em>). Not quite sure what to do next, but I knew I had to start from there.</p>\n<p>After reading about the best VPS providers out there, I finally went with <a href=\"https://m.do.co/c/4dc4ded1ea2f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Digital Ocean</a>. <strong>Great tutorials</strong>, easy for new comers, decent DNS management and good pricing — was a no-brainer.</p>\n<h3>CI tools everywhere</h3>\n<p>After signing up, I knew I needed some sort of tool that let me grab the code and automate the build process — the CI tool <em>(Continuous Integration)</em>. There are several of them out there, some of them targeted for open source projects, some primarily designed to be self hosted, some premium, some free. I chose Jenkins mainly for its concept of Pipelines and because I had some familiarity with the tool.</p>\n<p>Reading through some tutorials, it was relatively easy to get my Jenkins instance up and running. Now I needed to tell Jenkins to grab my code whenever I git pushed. Turns out there are dozens of posts out there on how to set up a GitHub webhook pointing from your repo to your Jenkins Droplet IP. Setting this up was faster than I expected (not quite straightforward for private GitHub repos, though).</p>\n<h3>Let’s recap</h3>\n<p>At this point I have a DO droplet running Linux with a Jenkins instance pulling code from GitHub on every git push. How cool, huh? Let’s see how our Magic box starts to reveal itself:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*3LI8drY9sq0GHcbKZe8JCg.png\" alt=\"Black box diagram with Digital Ocean Droplet and Jenkins\"><em>Black box diagram with Digital Ocean Droplet and Jenkins</em></p>\n<h3>Useful links:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/create/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">How to create a Droplet in Digital Ocean</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-jenkins-on-ubuntu-16-04\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">How to install Jenkins in a DO Droplet</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">How to set up and Jenkins pipeline</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-continuous-integration-pipelines-in-jenkins-on-ubuntu-16-04\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">How to integrate GitHub with Jenkins</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h2>2. Developing the magic</h2>\n<p>In the next few paragraphs, I’ll develop the core of my strategy which leverage Docker and DO droplets. Let’s dive right in.</p>\n<h3>Dockerize all the things</h3>\n<p>At this point, I have a <em>dist</em> folder with an <em>index.html</em> and its dependencies, ready to go. I know I need to spin up a webserver to serve these files over the web. Let’s then install <em>nginx</em> (or <em>Apache</em>) in the same server and serve the thing. I also need to install Node and a couple global node packages. Easy peasy, let’s do that…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“But wait, Carlos, that hmmm… that doesn’t feel like the right thing to do — you’d end up with a ton of stuff installed on your server and managing your dependencies will be a hell later on… just saying, though” — Inner self</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, I needed a way to encapsulate the dependencies, the <em>dist</em> artifact and even the webserver so that it wouldn’t mess up my server. Let’s use <strong>Docker</strong>. It would let me build an image with my webserver running on a port on my server, and my server filesystem would barely notice what I just did. How cool, huh?</p>\n<p>I set up a <a href=\"https://github.com/caroso1222/ast-viewer/blob/master/Dockerfile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dockerfile</a> for my app and edited the job in Jenkins to build a docker image and run the container with the 80 port exposed. It worked like charm. I could access my app live from <em><a href=\"http://my.server.ip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://my.server.ip</a></em>.</p>\n<h3>On scaling and stuff</h3>\n<p>I planned to have many applications deployed with this same schema using the same server. It wouldn’t make sense then to run Jenkins and all my containers in the same server. It just felt like I could do much better — I wanted to separate concerns. Sure I can juggle with different users, having Jenkins living in its own user, etc, but something within me really wanted to keep a machine specifically for building my applications.</p>\n<p>Based on this premise, I created another droplet (<em>aka server</em>) with less memory (no heavy lifting, just to serve webapps) and with Docker installed as it should be able to run Docker containers. I would then run all my apps in this server. This would let me scale well because I could easily change the memory allocation on my build server, while leaving my apps untouched.</p>\n<h3>Let’s recap</h3>\n<p>We’ve made quite a good progress. We’ve settled for Docker as our core build mechanism and we also decided to separate concerns in favor of maintainability by spinning up a separate production server in another server.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*_RrbIviKsUwOb10BqXsGyA.png\" alt=\"Deployment workflow with Docker and 2 DO droplets\"><em>Deployment workflow with Docker and 2 DO droplets</em></p>\n<h3>Useful links</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>How to Dockerize <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tiangolo/angular-in-docker-with-nginx-supporting-environments-built-with-multi-stage-docker-builds-bb9f1724e984\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Angular</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai2-blog/dockerizing-a-react-application-3563688a2378\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">React</a> and <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/dockerize-vuejs-app.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vue</a> apps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">How to install Docker in Ubuntu</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h2>3. From Magic to Live App</h2>\n<p>I wasn’t sure how to integrate my servers (build + prod). After <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49472695/how-to-run-container-in-a-remote-docker-host-with-jenkins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">asking for help</a> and researching, I came to the conclusion that, for my particular use case, I could implement the following workflow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Build the docker image in the <em>Build Server</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Push the docker image to my <em>Docker Hub</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Log in to my prod server via SSH</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pull the image from the <em>Docker Hub</em> and run the container</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It made sense as I didn’t have to resort to using tools like docker-machine or kubernetes to orchestrate my servers. <em>It just works,</em> it’s simple and it looks clean enough for me.</p>\n<p><em>Note on security:</em> It’s recommended to disable password based authentication on your production server and enable only <a href=\"https://hostpresto.com/community/tutorials/how-to-enable-key-based-authentication-for-ssh-on-your-linux-server/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">key based authentication from your build server</a>. That is, it will be virtually impossible to login to your prod server if not from your build server.</p>\n<h3>Show me some code</h3>\n<p>A technical post is not a technical post until you show some code.

I run the container on port 8080, but that’s because I set up nginx to route the traffic to several containers in the same server via subdomain <em>proxy_pass</em> (e.g. domainA.com serves container A, domainB.com serves container B). I won’t elaborate on this technique as it falls out of the scope of this post.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As stated at the beginning of this post, this pipeline runs on every <code class=\"language-text\">git push</code> made in master.

That’s the beauty of it. In this post I covered just one of these strategies that grants me full control over my custom deployment pipeline using two servers, a CI and Docker.</p>\n<p>It all might sound daunting if you’re not very familiar with the concepts we covered. Fear not, I say. It’s a long post mainly because it sums up a learning journey which spanned across almost 3 months, putting 1–2 hours each night grinding on these servers and reading stuff I was not very familiar with.</p>\n<p>Even if you’re a FrontEnd developer focused on browser-land, I still think it’s very valuable that you get familiar with the full stack. It will give you the tools to have a solid conversation and form an opinion when discussing DevOps stuff in your company. It’s better to say *“you guys are the experts, but this is my opinion on the matter…” *than saying “<em>well, that’s not my thing, you ops guys figure it out”.</em></p>\n<p>I hope you got some inspiration to go ahead and implement your personal deployment pipeline and get to know all this DevOps tech — tons of fun ahead!</p>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h1>Shameless self promotion</h1>\n<p>I’m not an amateur SoundCloud rapper nor I’m looking for funds in Patreon.
