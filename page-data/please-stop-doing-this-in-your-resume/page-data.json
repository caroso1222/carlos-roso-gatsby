I’m a very charismatic, process-oriented person with self-learning abilities. I’m also a very strong team player with a passion for building and creating new things. On top of that, I have organization and proactivity skills that allow me to produce high-quality work. I have good verbal and written communication which makes me a great team player.

This applies to everything but, mostly, to your summary. That first paragraph should be your 10 seconds aggressive pitch.</p>\n<p>One thing you perhaps didn’t know: In paper everyone is charismatic, everyone is a great <em>team player</em>, and everyone has great written skills (eye roll). Everyone is efficient and organized. Every single developer likes to learn new things! You’re wasting your recruiter’s attention on useless verbosity which says nothing about <strong>what makes you different</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>“Sure, but, they still have time to go over my soft skills, don’t they?”</em></p>\n<p>## The myth of the 12 seconds attention span</p>\n<p>Some say humans have the attention span of a goldfish which is like 8-12 seconds. The BBC <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/health-38896790\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">debunked that myth</a> a few years ago. But, being brutally honest, do we need more research to accept our attention span is dead-limited?</p>\n<p>Let’s say your average recruiter has 30 seconds to make a first impression about you (and 30 seconds is a lot these days). Time yourself reading the first paragraph of this post. I’ll save you the hassle: it’ll take you roughly 13-18 seconds. That being said, <strong>do you really want to waste half of your recruiter’s attention span with your verbosity</strong>?</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 662px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/649bf2015d216a579643c989ea89c631/31198/span.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 71.08433734939759%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"recruiter attention span\"\n        title=\"recruiter attention span\"\n        src=\"/static/649bf2015d216a579643c989ea89c631/be86f/span.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/649bf2015d216a579643c989ea89c631/e72ac/span.png 166w,\n/static/649bf2015d216a579643c989ea89c631/62452/span.png 331w,\n/static/649bf2015d216a579643c989ea89c631/be86f/span.png 662w,\n/static/649bf2015d216a579643c989ea89c631/31198/span.png 694w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h1>Cut the cr#p</h1>\n<p>So, by now you’re sold. Or perhaps not. Maybe you still think your great verbal skills (on paper) makes you a gold-special developer. In any case, just to put it crystal clear: <strong>avoid unnecessary verbosity and cut all those soft skills from your resume’s summary</strong>. They are very important on your day job but they have no place in your resume.</p>\n<p>Are you a good learner? cool, make me infer that by pointing me to your learning in Python, C++ and Svelte. Are you a strong leader? nice, make me see that in your work experience when you lead a team of 5 devs to ship 8 microservices serving 25k requests per day. Are you a charismatic, people-oriented person? great, then I should infer that when you tell me you’re a speaker, a blogger, an online course teacher.</p>\n<p>Let’s practice. This post would be incomplete if I don’t show you an example of what to avoid and how to improve. Remember the Resume Golden Rule (which I just made up): <strong>you have less than 30 seconds to convince your recruiter to keep reading your resume</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Example 1: Frontend Developer</h2>\n<h3>Bad</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Proactive Frontend developer with a passion for learning new things.
