I will miss my team, a lot. Had a really great time with them, it was 1.5 years where I learned so much about 2D and 3D rendering in the browser. Got very experienced with FabricJS, ThreeJS and Angular Material. The team also gave me the freedom to travel around the world, that’s priceless.</p>\n<p>Even when I didn’t woke up early today, I had a very productive day afterwards. Put on my last 4 hours of contract work, then I reviewed a <a href=\"/resume-review/uzoma\">resume</a>, wrote <a href=\"/the-fast-and-easy-way-to-create-a-typescript-library\">80% of a new article on TypeScript</a> and made some progress on the CTTI guide (chose a new algorithm, implemented the solution, ready to write it in the guide).</p>\n<p>I was also very active on Twitter today. Not so much consuming, but tweeting instead. My main purpose is to build up that audience and have more people to offer my help to. As everyone else, I have opinions I’d like to share.</p>\n<p>I need to listen more to the what the community needs, in terms of kickstarting a career in dev. That’s going to be my focus in the next few weeks while I keep writing on how to get into these top remote companies.</p>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h1>Data Report</h1>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid news</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Personal growth</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Wake up 5:00 am</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Workout</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Help someone</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Time wasted &#x3C; 90 mins</strong>: No</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Finances</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spent</strong>: 25USD</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (24h)</strong>: +0.44%</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (All time)</strong>: +12.09%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (24h)</strong>: -0.68%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (All time)</strong>: +95.76%</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 46","description":"Last day at work","meta":null,"date":"May 04, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-46/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/resume-review/uzoma/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Resume Review - Uzoma"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/4-tricks-to-instantly-boost-up-your-algorithms-game-bigo-made-super-easy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"4 tricks to instantly boost up your algorithms game"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
