I’m literally so full of ideas that I’m pretty much, well, ”<em>out of ideas</em>”. Not quite sure what to pursue and how to better spend my time. On the other side, I decided to just take some action and keep doing and shipping things.</p>\n<p>I noticed there’s no good terminal reminder for Mac, just as Slack has its <code class=\"language-text\">/reminder</code> shortcut. I spent the whole day coming up with a good solution for this problem and made it open source. I ended up with a pretty solid, working solution.</p>\n<p>Overall, working and creating took me out from my mind-block state, and I think that’s fine. I’ll need to do some more fine planning and user research to see where to go next. I still think building an audience is paramount for my goals, long term.</p>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h1>Data Report</h1>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid news</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Personal growth</strong>: Yes.
