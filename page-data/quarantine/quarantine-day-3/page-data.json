Of course, I felt the urge to do so. I resisted. I can totally feel the pain of those who’re suffering, but I can’t help or do much about it, sadly. I focus on my circle of influence - those ones I can help in some way or another. I keep an eye on their situation; those are relevant news for me, personally.</p>\n<p>Not reading any news positively impacted the way I went through my day. I felt more positive, a bit more energetic, a lot more driven to help. I feel, though, I still need to catch up. I might set apart one day in the week to do so, or not. We’ll see.</p>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h1>Data Report</h1>\n<h2>Time management</h2>\n<p>Sundays are for wife and family. I spent a lot of time watching Netflix with my wife. I don’t always feel good watching that much TV, but I do appreciate every minute I get to spend with her.</p>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid news</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Personal growth</strong>: Yes.
