I’ve been digging into OSX automation which has been fun so far. Building a CLI for the Reminders app has been a bit more challenging than expect, there’s little to no documentation online. Making good progress building my first Nodejs/TypeScript wrapper to interact with the app.</p>\n<p>I learned something very valuable today from my book “Before you know it”, by John Bargh. It’s called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation_intention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Implementation Intention</a> and it’s a powerful technique to reach those difficult goals that would normally require a lot of self-discipline and/or self-control. It states that if you have a clear plan for a goal which involves specific time and place, you’ll be more likely to accomplish it. The reason is because the unconscious reacts to external factors such as the place you’re in, the weather, the colors, smelling, etc. So, it’s different to say “I’ll cook something new today” than saying “After stepping out of the office at noon, I’ll get to the kitchen, open my laptop, play the YouTube video, get the vegetables out and fire up the pan”. That’s an implementation plan right there, it involves place (office, kitchen) and time (at noon).</p>\n<p>I’ll start working on this, see how that goes.</p>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h1>Data Report</h1>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid news</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Personal growth</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Wake up 5:00 am</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Workout</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Help someone</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Time wasted &#x3C; 90 mins</strong>: Yes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Finances</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spent</strong>: 17 USD</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (24h)</strong>: -0.02%</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (All time)</strong>: +7.93%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (24h)</strong>: -7.4%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (All time)</strong>: +50.89%</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 22","description":"Implementation Intention","meta":null,"date":"April 10, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-22/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-21/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 21"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-23/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 23"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
