Felt super unproductive, not sure what happened. But no problem, I’m accepting it as it is.</p>\n<p>I sent out my 3rd newsletter, keeping consistency over there, feeling solid. I also applied to a new top-remote platform called <a href=\"https://www.gun.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gun.io</a>. I wanted to see how the process looks like to be able to write meaningful recommendations. I managed to pass the algorithm test in my first try, scoring 72nd percentile. I think that’s not too good but I’m confident I can make it to the 90th percentile with practice and more tries.</p>\n<p>Finally, I made good progress on my guide Cracking the Toptal Interview. I think I’m almost there, maybe 85-90% done. I’ll keep on grinding.</p>\n<p>In other news, the quarantine has been extended 2 more weeks as expected. I’m happy about that honestly. This has been a time like no other for me.</p>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h1>Data Report</h1>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid news</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Personal growth</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Wake up 5:00 am</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Workout</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Help someone</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Time wasted &#x3C; 90 mins</strong>: Yes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Finances</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spent</strong>: 0 USD</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (24h)</strong>: +0.05%</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (All time)</strong>: +12.93%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (24h)</strong>: -0.43%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (All time)</strong>: +94.16%</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 48","description":"Quarantine extended","meta":null,"date":"May 06, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-48/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-47/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 47"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/resume-review/giancarlos/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Resume review - Giancarlos"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
