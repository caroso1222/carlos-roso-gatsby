It’s something I’ll take to my cookie jar. I was able to finish a project I once envisioned in my mind. I wasn’t consistent but I and Edgar made it happen in the end. It’s a reminder that I can finish what I start. I’m not only a starter, I’m a finisher too!</p>\n<p>My take on React vs. Angular after this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>React is simple to reason about. I’d go with it for any small personal project. I would also avoid Redux at all cost.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Angular still feels a lot more robust for me. Reactive forms, dependency injection and view encapsulation makes it a great option for big projects. I’m much more productive with it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 107","description":"Logoquiz.dev!","meta":null,"date":"July 03, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-107/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-106/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 106"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-108/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 108"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
