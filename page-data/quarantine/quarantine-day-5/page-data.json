It was my first non-vacation day in years that I could spend working on my own projects. I resumed work on <a href=\"https://github.com/caroso1222/notyf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Notyf</a> which is my beloved best open source project. I hope to release a new version tomorrow.</p>\n<p>It’s been another day without news bombing on me. I’ve heard by friends things are not looking good for Colombia. I keep forced into quarantine for the best of everyone.</p>\n<p>Mental health is 100%. I’m enjoying my time at home and I’m very much looking forward to what I’ll be able to produce these next few weeks.</p>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h1>Data Report</h1>\n<h2>Time management</h2>\n<p>Productive, well balanced day.
