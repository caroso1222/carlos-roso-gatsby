I woke up at 5:00 AM but was self-pushed to turn off the alarm and go back to sleep. I don’t judge, though - it’s nice to reflect and understand what was the reason for that behavior. I spent 2 minutes thinking about things I’m grateful for and replaying them on my mind. This was enough to get me out of bed to start grinding. Late start, almost 9am, but it literally costed me nothing to do it. It’s a reminder, for myself, that no day sucks intrinsically, it only sucks in my mind. My mind is, well, mine, so I can change it as I please. Practicing gratitude is one way to unblock it, for me.</p>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h1>Data Report</h1>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid news</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Personal growth</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Wake up 5:00 am</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Workout</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Help someone</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Time wasted &#x3C; 90 mins</strong>: Yes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Finances</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spent</strong>: 35 USD</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (24h)</strong>: +0.38%</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (All time)</strong>: +11.97%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (24h)</strong>: -6.21%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (All time)</strong>: +50.25%%</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 32","description":"Finally exercised.
