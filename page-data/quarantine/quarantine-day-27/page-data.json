I feel like practicing this everyday has made it a lot easier over time. I wrote three posts today (including this): a <a href=\"how-to-preview-a-readme-with-github-styles/\">technical</a> one and a <a href=\"https://carlosroso.com/please-stop-doing-this-in-your-resume/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">more career oriented</a> one.</p>\n<p>I feel like communicating ideas is easier like this. I open my editor and start typing on markdown, black background. That’s all about productivity.</p>\n<p>Also, I wrote about <em><a href=\"/quarantine/quarantine-day-22\">implementation intention</a></em> a couple days ago and found it to be very effective. I’m setting specific goals with place and time and I’m getting a lot more focus. It’s leverage on the unconscious like crazy.</p>\n<p>Can’t feel happier about this quarantine. This has been an amazing time to grow on a personal level. It’s like getting the best out of the worst situation.</p>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h1>Data Report</h1>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid news</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Personal growth</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Wake up 5:00 am</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Workout</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Help someone</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Time wasted &#x3C; 90 mins</strong>: Yes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Finances</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spent</strong>: 0 USD</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (24h)</strong>: -1.01%</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (All time)</strong>: +9.24%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (24h)</strong>: -3.52%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (All time)</strong>: +42.92%</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 27","description":"I think I have a passion for writing","meta":null,"date":"April 15, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-27/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/please-stop-doing-this-in-your-resume/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Please stop doing this in your resume"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-right-way-to-migrate-your-bash-profile-to-zsh/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The right way to migrate your bash_profile to zsh"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
