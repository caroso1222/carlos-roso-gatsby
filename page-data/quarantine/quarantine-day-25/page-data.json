Woke up very early, had a very nice instrospection session. Wrote a lot of pages about my goals, my personal statement, my thoughts on the current situation, my purpose. Spent like 2 hours drinking coffee, stretching, thinking and writing.</p>\n<p>Iâ€™ve also used some time in the day to review resumes like <a href=\"/resume-review/andres\">this</a> or <a href=\"/resume-review/santiago\">this</a>. It all started with this tweet:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ðŸ”¥For those hunting jobs in this quarantine, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jdjuan\">@jdjuan</a> and I are willing to review your CV and give some free advice.<br><br>We've both been lucky applying to jobs so far, now we want to help you as well. ðŸ˜€<br><br>Shoot any of us a DM!<br><br>RT if you know someone who could use the help too.</p>â€” Carlos Roso (@caroso1222) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/caroso1222/status/1248958395819921408\">April 11, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<p>Itâ€™s been great spending time on each particular case, I feel like Iâ€™m learning a lot doing this exercise as well.</p>\n<p>I finally put together a sketch on what the Cracking the Toptal Interview will look like. Getting there, launching first draft really soon.</p>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h1>Data Report</h1>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid news</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Personal growth</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Wake up 5:00 am</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Workout</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Help someone</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Time wasted &#x3C; 90 mins</strong>: Yes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Finances</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spent</strong>: 0 USD</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (24h)</strong>: +0.07%</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (All time)</strong>: +8.03%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (24h)</strong>: -2.59%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (All time)</strong>: +46.38%</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantineâ€Šâ€”â€ŠDay 25","description":"Deep introspection.
