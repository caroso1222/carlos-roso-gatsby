I published my first post on <a href=\"https://dev.to/caroso1222/how-i-got-into-the-most-exclusive-remote-working-platforms-45dk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">dev.to</a>, wrote a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@caroso1222/this-is-what-i-did-to-ace-the-hardest-remote-work-interviews-at-toptal-f243c35799ae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">draft</a> on Medium and also wrote a <a href=\"/how-to-run-multiple-curl-requests-sequentially\">technical post</a> in this blog. I also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/caroso1222/status/1248260358139252736\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tweeted</a> to get more attention on the DEV post and I finally posted a question in <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/post/i-got-my-first-30-subs-how-can-i-get-to-100-5386844fd8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">IndieHackers</a> to get advice on growth. I’m not used to be that active on social media so I got a burst of social anxiety.</p>\n<p>For like 4 hours after publishing everything, I got myself stuck in that nasty pit of checking metrics and notifications all over the place. I was trying to focus on something else but my mind kept wandering and seeking for that dopamine shot on social media.</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35011639-before-you-know-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">read the other day</a> that your unconscious never stops thinking about your dreams and goals. Even when you think you’re distracted, in keeps poking around and seeking for updates on your goals. Now, if I’m honestly concerned about follower growth and banal metrics, that’s what my unconscious will seek whether I want it or not. I need to keep reminding myself, and truly believe, I’m doing this just to help, to give away my learnings - that, I think, will substitute that dopamine intake and nuke the social anxiety.</p>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h1>Data Report</h1>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid news</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Personal growth</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Wake up 5:00 am</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Workout</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Help someone</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Time wasted &#x3C; 90 mins</strong>: Yes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Finances</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spent</strong>: 10 USD</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (24h)</strong>: +1.55%</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (All time)</strong>: +7.95%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (24h)</strong>: -1.93%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (All time)</strong>: +62.94%</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 21","description":"So this is what social anxiety feels like","meta":null,"date":"April 09, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-21/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-run-multiple-curl-requests-sequentially/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to run multiple curl requests sequentially"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-22/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 22"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
