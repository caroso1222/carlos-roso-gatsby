It’s been almost a year since I first started working on this idea and I’m happy to see it materialized. It’s a very beta version, with a hundred bugs, but it’s pretty functional.</p>\n<p>I also started doing with brain warmups. This is a concept I developed to get my brain warmed up before diving into real qork. I thought about it based on the following 3 arguments:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>I have a very bad habit of not jumping right on the important tasks when turning on my laptop. I wander on Twitter, Dev, YouTube, news, etc, until I finally hit my zone. This is a huge waste of brain power.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You don’t eliminate a bad habit. You replace it with a good one.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The brain is a muscle. Therefore, it needs warm up or else it will show resistance to embrace sudden hard work.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I outlined a series of simple, short brain warm-up exercises to build momentum and jump right into action. Simple algorithms, quick routines, basic math puzzles, short frontend/backend challenges, etc. It can also be done on a notebook (physical) but it’s better if it’s on the laptop.</p>\n<p>This was my first day and it worked wonders. Let’s see how this new experiment goes.</p>\n<h2>Brain warm-up exercises</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Write some code on paper</li>\n<li>Open repl.it. Code an easy algorithm from Leetcode.</li>\n<li>Write a few lines of an open source project</li>\n<li>Only warm up with technologies similar to those that you will work on in the day</li>\n<li>Code vomit an idea, just code without googling stuff</li>\n<li>Visualize and write down the first minutes of the day</li>\n<li>Don’t stretch too much. It’s not meant to be difficult, just build momentum.</li>\n<li>Spend no more than 10 mins warming up.</li>\n<li>Do more than 1 warming in the day, if necessary.</li>\n<li>Combine between paper and typing.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 100","description":"Brain warm up","meta":null,"date":"June 26, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-100/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-99/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 99"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-101/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 101"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
