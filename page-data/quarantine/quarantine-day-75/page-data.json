I meditated twice and had the opportunity to write about what time means for me and identify my distractions. This is what I finally came up with:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Twitter is not absolutely mandatory. That’s just a means to an end.</li>\n<li>I should spend no more than 15 mins on Instagram, just to support my wife.</li>\n<li>Youtube is a huge distraction for me. I’ll spend my time on Youtube like this: 10 mins meditation, 10 mins personal growth video in the morning, 10 mins historical video in the evening.</li>\n<li>Uninstall Panda new tab extension</li>\n<li>Check email only 10 mins at night</li>\n<li>Increase daily meditation time to 20 mins</li>\n<li>Blog posts are distractions too. Every read post should have its written reflection.</li>\n<li>Close all tabs before turning off the laptop</li>\n<li>Use Whatsapp only to communicate, not just to seek distraction</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I also cooked a new cool dish: spinach cake with egg.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 75","description":"Time and distractions","meta":null,"date":"June 02, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-75/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-74/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 74"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-76/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 76"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
