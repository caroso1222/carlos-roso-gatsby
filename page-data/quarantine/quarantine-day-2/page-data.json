I felt like I missed nothing, though. Family and friends over WhatsApp are the only source of reliable news I got for the moment, and I feel ok about it.</p>\n<p>I feel like I have a lot to read, a lot to learn, a lot of ideas yet to jot down, that I can’t really feel bored. If it wasn’t for my wife I’d be writing code all day - but I’m thankful she’s keeping my mental sanity on track.</p>\n<p>Overall feeling good. This is just getting started.</p>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h1>Data Report</h1>\n<h2>Time management</h2>\n<p>I put a lot of time on my Saturday to work on this blog. It was totally worth it as I’d been working in the redesign for quite a few months - finally launched.</p>\n<p>I spent no more than 15 mins reading news on Twitter and that was enough. I learned nothing new besides reading rants against the president. Later on the day my wife told me the quarantine was extended. That’s a important piece of news and I’m glad I got family keeping me up to date - that’s enough for me.</p>\n<p>Overall, I feel pretty good about this day.</p>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid news</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Personal growth</strong>: Yes.
