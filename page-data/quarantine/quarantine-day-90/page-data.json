Had one that particularly made me reason about integrity. I’m always betting on the win-win for both parts, even if that means me not getting the fastest deal. It’s the best strategy long term, effectively trashing the short term gains. I was very honest and told the potential customer his decision to buy this apartment as an investment might not be as clever as he thought. Rents are not that high over here and, moving forward, post-COVID times won’t make it good for an investment. I’m not interested in him losing money. Having been really transparent upfront made me feel better and he was even willing to offer more.</p>\n<p>Integrity and honesty are essential part of my core values and it feels way better to abide to them, than to trash them for short-term gains.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 90","description":"On integrity","meta":null,"date":"June 16, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-90/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-89/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 89"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-91/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 91"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
