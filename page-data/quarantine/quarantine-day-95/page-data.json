This was a decision we made back when we were traveling and realized the financial cost of keep it while living abroad was something we were not willing to assume. It’s a bittersweet feeling as we had so much fun on this place, our very first. On the other hand, having to pay a loan was a very high opportunity cost as we’d otherwise invest that money. Owning a place is very expensive but I reckon it’s very fulfilling and emotionally important.</p>\n<p>I’m letting go relatively easy as, for me, home is where my heart is - and that’s not a physical place for me. My heart is with my wife, my family, myself, my freedom. What you own, owns you.</p>\n<p>I’m so grateful for this place. I’ll always remember it as an amazing time in my life.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 95","description":"The sale happened","meta":null,"date":"June 21, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-95/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-94/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 94"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-96/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 96"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
