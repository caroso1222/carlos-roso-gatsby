Pivoted real quick from the initial, working solution as it required some low, dark permissions in the OS. Will work with Apple Reminders directly.</p>\n<p>I logged into Twitter to see what people are talking about in tech but, again, it was a bad idea. I found nothing interesting, it was mostly a waste of time (+60 mins). Also checked HN &#x26; DEV.to, that was a bit more productive as I got to find some cool resources.</p>\n<p>Put 2 hours of work in my contract work from Toptal and, after that, kept working on my initiative to write a book on my learnings for remote work.</p>\n<p>Overall, I feel it was a pretty good, productive day - full of learnings (learned about Applescript, which was totally new to me).</p>\n<p>2 weeks in quarantine have had no significant impact on me, at least mentally. Keeping focused, busy and motivated has helped my mental sanity a lot. I keep waking up early (4:50am) - mornings are a blessing, for real.</p>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h1>Data Report</h1>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid news</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Personal growth</strong>: Yes.
