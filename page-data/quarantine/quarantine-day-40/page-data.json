I’m preparing my first <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AngularBogota/status/1254587162244395009\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tech talk</a> ever and, even being a topic I’m pretty fluent in, it feels pretty intimidating. Staring at a blank piece of paper trying to lay out a good piece of content is, no joke, the most difficult creative task I’ve tackled. I felt overwhelmed at some point and just got paralized. Took a nap intentionally, seeked distraction, and engaged in non-important conversations. It was my brain avoiding the awkward moment of simply “thinking” or “failing”. It’s that stupid will to get everything quickly and perfect what triggers the boredom of not spending hours with myself thinking about a problem. I’ll go back to my deep-work times.</p>\n<p>I ended up gaining control just when I was about to give up, and I’m proud. It costed me hours, but I won.</p>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h1>Data Report</h1>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid news</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Personal growth</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Wake up 5:00 am</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Workout</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Help someone</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Time wasted &#x3C; 90 mins</strong>: Yes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Finances</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spent</strong>: 17 USD</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (24h)</strong>: +0.72%</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (All time)</strong>: +12.63%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (24h)</strong>: +6.74%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (All time)</strong>: +81.47%</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 40","description":"Beating paralysis","meta":null,"date":"April 28, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-40/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-ultimate-checklist-to-the-full-stack-interview-project/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The ultimate 8-bullet checklist to ace the Full Stack interview project"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-add-live-reload-to-static-page/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to add live reload to a static page"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
