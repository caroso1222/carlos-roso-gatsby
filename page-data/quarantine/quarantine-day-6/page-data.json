I first had an amazing, productive morning. Released a new version of <a href=\"https://github.com/caroso1222/notyf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Notyf</a>, my beloved open source project.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, corona hit me hard - I got this cynical urge to read news. At first I just wanted to see what people are talking about on Twitter, see if I should share my tech stories as well. Then I got swamped with news. Memes, news, “expert opinions”, got a lot of crap on me. I ended up spending roughly 3 hours in Twitter which I totally regret.</p>\n<p>Transitioning from being employed full-time to working on my projects is hard for now. It’s not easy to concentrate in one project and, I suppose, that kind of wandering is drifting me away from deep work. I consider myself to be disciplined but this will surely require 3x effort. I’m getting there; I’ll get there.</p>\n<h1>Data Report</h1>\n<h2>Time management</h2>\n<p>Terrible time management. Spending +2.5 hours in Twitter was certainly a waste of time I could’ve used to call my family, to read, write or code.</p>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid news</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Personal growth</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Wake up 5:00 am</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Workout</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Help someone</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Time wasted &#x3C; 90 mins</strong>: No</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Finances</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spent</strong>: 60 USD</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (24h)</strong>: +2.39%</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (All time)</strong>: +6.93%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (24h)</strong>: +0.1%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (All time)</strong>: +8.04%</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 6","description":"Great morning.
