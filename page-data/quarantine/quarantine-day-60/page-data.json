I finally finished the Cracking the Toptal Interview guide. So proud to have been able to pull this off. I first thought about this on Apr 3 so it took me like 6 weeks from ideation to completion. It’s way more than I initially expected but it was totally worth it. I wasn’t full time into this either. I feel like, with full time focus, it could’ve taken me 3 weeks to complete. What I thought was going to be 15 pages initially turned out to be 50. I really hope this helps a lot of people.</p>\n<p>I have a new project I want to pursue now. I’ll write/record a paid mini-course with learnings for BigO complexity and algorithms. I want to bring this topic closer to devs who are not familiar with this topic in a very friendly way. It’ll also be a cool experiment to find out whether I can sell something online. I hope that helps people as well.</p>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h1>Data Report</h1>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid news</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Personal growth</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Wake up 5:00 am</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Workout</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Help someone</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Time wasted &#x3C; 90 mins</strong>: No</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Finances</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spent</strong>: 0 USD</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (24h)</strong>: -1.21%</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (All time)</strong>: +14.78%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (24h)</strong>: +3.75%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (All time)</strong>: +109.10%</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 60","description":"Netflix WWII","meta":null,"date":"May 18, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-60/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-59/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 59"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/hashmaps-like-you-have-never-seen-them/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hashmaps like you've never seen them"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
