I’ve been slowly falling in love with psychology lately. Been reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/-/es/John-Bargh-Ph-D/dp/1501101218\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Before You Know It</a> by John Bargh and, no kidding, I get mindblown every 5 pages. It’s all about the unconscious and how it silently affect every single action we take.</p>\n<p>How are my goals and desires unconsciously affecting my daily actions? my relationships? It’s scary to learn that subtle things like being hungry can make you act like a moron. It’s like your brain is trying to replenish your need for food with abundant shopping, even for things you don’t need. Scientifically proven, you become a shopping maniac when hungry, and that’s scary.</p>\n<p>Am I being at least conscious of how my desires affect my views on life? Food for thought.</p>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h1>Data Report</h1>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid news</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Personal growth</strong>: Yes.
