I was able to enjoy my time writing, reading, watching personal growth videos. I also helped wife on her Instagram. I wrote today about freedom and what it means for me. Seems like freedom and happines is the end, and money is just a means for that. If freedom means something specific to me, then money should take me there. I don’t need a whole lot of it to get to my sweet spot. In fact, I already have enough to be in that spot. I’ll write more about this later.</p>\n<p>I also cooked a fancy new dish today: pasta carbonara.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 74","description":"Vacations!","meta":null,"date":"June 01, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-74/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-73/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 73"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-75/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 75"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
