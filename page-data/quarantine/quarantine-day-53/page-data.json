Wife had to work on her business so we decided to take this Monday off. I just chilled out, watched some Netflix series, watched history videos and eat shrimps.</p>\n<p>I’m proud I was finally able to take time and create a good weekly schedule for the upcoming months. Context switching is not benefitial for me as it becomes harder to focus and make good progress. I decided then to try and focus on one thing a day. Let’s see how my experient finally pans out. It goes something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monday: Writing. I’ll focus on making progress on long form writings: e-books, PDF guides, etc.</li>\n<li>Tuesday: Writing. Focus on short form posts: prepare newsletter, write blog posts, catch up with writing ideas.</li>\n<li>Wednesday: Writing &#x26; community. Review resumes, answer questions, prepare tweets for teaching, prepare for conferences, <strong>send newsletter</strong></li>\n<li>Thursday &#x26; Friday: Open source &#x26; coding. Focus solely on maintaining my open source projects or working coding side project.</li>\n<li>Saturday: Creative flow. Design, photography, photo editing, cooking.</li>\n<li>Sunday: Introspection, weekly planning, time to reflect, long meditation.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h1>Data Report</h1>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid news</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Personal growth</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Wake up 5:00 am</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Workout</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Help someone</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Time wasted &#x3C; 90 mins</strong>: Yes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Finances</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spent</strong>: 20 USD</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (24h)</strong>: +0.7%</li>\n<li><strong>Stocks Portfolio (All time)</strong>: +15.15%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (24h)</strong>: -0.73%</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptofolio (All time)</strong>: +90.09%</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 53","description":"Day off - new weekly planning","meta":null,"date":"May 11, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-53/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-52/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 52"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-absolute-best-way-to-show-work-experience-in-your-resume/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Resume Pro Tip: The absolute best way to show your work experience"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
