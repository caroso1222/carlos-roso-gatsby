Apart from journaling and cooking, I managed to read for like 6 hours, and I felt good about it. This is what I’m reading:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tribe of Mentors, Tim Ferriss</li>\n<li>Can’t Hurt Me. David Goggings.</li>\n<li>21 lessons for 21 century. Yuval Noah Harari.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also reflected on success, why I consider myself to be successful, how I define success and what I’m willing to strive for in my next years. Details are kept private, but overall it means <strong>freedom</strong> (professional, economic), stick to my values, help people with a lot of material, and have great relationships.</p>\n<p>Main takeaway: Success, for me, should be measured inwards, not outwards.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 79","description":"Books and books","meta":null,"date":"June 05, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-79/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-78/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 78"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine/quarantine-day-80/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine — Day 80"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
