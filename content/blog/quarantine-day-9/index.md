# Quick update

I used my day to read a lot and share some Netflix time with my wife. I've been slowly falling in love with psychology lately. Been reading [Before You Know It](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/John-Bargh-Ph-D/dp/1501101218) by John Bargh and, no kidding, I get mindblown every 5 pages. It's all about the unconscious and how it silently affect every single action we take.

How are my goals and desires unconsciously affecting my daily actions? my relationships? It's scary to learn that subtle things like being hungry can make you act like a moron. It's like your brain is trying to replenish your need for food with abundant shopping, even for things you don't need. Scientifically proven, you become a shopping maniac when hungry, and that's scary. 

Am I being at least conscious of how my desires affect my views on life? Food for thought.
