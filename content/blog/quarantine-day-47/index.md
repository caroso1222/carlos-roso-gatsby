# Quick update

Lots of Twitter today. Not so much consuming but creating. I like that, I feel like I'm finally able to say everything I wanted in there. Now I need to focus my energy correctly. I'm spending too much and, even when I don't have metrics shown up, I still go through the comments.

I need to find an automatic poster so that I don't even have to go there to post, just put my word out there without having to be in that distraction cage.

Feeling good as I launched an update to the CTTI guide (v1.2) and prepared my next newsletter. Today could've been a lot more productive, for sure, but I'll get better at it.

Feeling on fire for whatever comes next.
