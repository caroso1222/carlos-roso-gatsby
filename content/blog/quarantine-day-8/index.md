# Quick update

I've been consistently avoiding distractions these weeks. Doesn't seem like a particularly difficult thing to achieve for me. But, having all the time to work on my projects, it's too difficult to focus.

I got a ton of ideas I'm not really sure where to start or which one to commit to. I keep doing solid progress on [Notyf](https://github.com/caroso1222/notyf), and I'm happy about it. But, other than that, I'm having a hard time finding my *side hustle*. Not sure if I should just try whatever comes to mind, or keep thinking thoroughly about it.

Let's see what the next week brings on me.
