There are 2 ways to land remote work these days: you either apply for companies directly (or via referrals), or you go to freelancing sites and land jobs there. This last kind can be classified in 2 as well: 

1. Non-vetting platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, or Freeeup where you create an account and start applying to jobs.
2. Vetting platforms where you need to pass 3-4 tough engineering filters to get accepted like Toptal, TripleByte or CrossOver.

I'll talk about the second category here. Yes, you'll probably spend a lot of time in these interviews, but you'll likely get paid 2x or 3x compared to non-vetting platforms.

I myself have worked on some of these and can honestly say it's changed my life.

# Toptal

* **Experience required:** You're expected to be fluent in your tech stack. I'd say you need somewhere between 2-3 years of experience.
* **Pros:** Excellent salary. Vetting for clients too. Full-time & part-time mainly.
* **Cons:** Tough and lengthy interview process.
* **Interview:** [4 steps](https://www.toptal.com/top-3-percent): English interview, online coding assessment, live algorithms screening, take-home project. It can be heavy on algorithms.
* **Salary (USD/year):** Frontend: [80k-120k](https://www.toptal.com/developers/front-end/hourly-rate). Backend: [70k-120k](https://www.toptal.com/developers/back-end/hourly-rate). Machine Learning: [80k-130k](https://www.toptal.com/developers/machine-learning/hourly-rate).

# CrossOver

* **Experience required:** They have a huge variety of openings ranging from 2 years exp for junior developers to +15 years exp for high level managers. You'll need familiarity with JavaScript, C#, C++ or Java.
* **Pros:** Good salary. Only long term, full-time work.
* **Cons:** They take screenshots of your machine every 10 minutes to make sure you're not on Facebook or Twitter.
* **Interview:** 6 steps: basic fit, psychometric ([CCAT](https://www.criteriacorp.com/resources/ccat_prep.php): basic math and logic test), language, software questions (multiple choice), 2 free response questions, and the final interview with a hiring manager. You have 13 days to complete.
* **Salary (USD/year)** Junior: [30k](https://www.crossover.com/job-software-engineer). Mid level: [60k](https://www.crossover.com/job-software-architect).

# TripleByte

* **Experience required:** 2-3 years of experience and good preparation to pass the online quiz and interview.
* **Pros:** Excellent pay. Good, well-funded startups to work for. No resume or credentials needed.
* **Cons:** Mostly for onsite US jobs. Few offers for remote only.
* **Interview:** 3 attemps to pass a 35 question quiz. 2 mins per question. 2-hour Skype interview afterwards. Make sure you apply to "Remote only" positions.

# Turing

* **Experience required:** At least [2 years](https://welcome.turing.com/) of industry experience as a software engineer.
* **Pros:** Legit company with hires all over the world ([Africa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-MfqXSXoKk), [Brasil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwkAfjuD9Bw), [Pakistan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXTYsG0FwnQ))
* **Cons:** Tough and lengthy interview process. Less than 1% accepted.
* **Interview:** Unclear number of steps. You can easily go through algorithm tests, multiple choice quiz for a specific tech stack, live interview with coding task, and maybe you also need to build a take-home project.
* **Salary (USD/year)**: Based on my research, you won't probably get more than 100k/yr.

# Arc

* **Experience required:** You'll have it pretty difficult to pass with less than 2-3 years.
* **Pros:** Full-time and hourly jobs. Great [online reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/arc.dev). You can set your expected salary.
* **Cons:** Lengthy interview process

# Gun.io

* **Experience required:** Their vetting process is not hard - I'd say +1.5 years of experience is enough to apply.
* **Pros:** Short, easy application process.
* **Cons:** The site is not polished, lacks design and feels buggy at times. Requires a reference from a previous employer. Mostly hourly, contract work, not full-time.
* **Interview:** 3 step process: Reference check from a previous employer (this one is weird), 3 online algorithm challenge, video self-interview (just you and your camera).
* **Salary:** Mostly hourly contract work. [$40-$70 USD/hr](https://twitter.com/caroso1222/status/1260583747591815176).
