*"Step out of your comfort zone"*. That quote alone has sold millions in self-help content. They say it's the only way to grow. But, is it?

Moving on too often is destructive.

Millenials switch jobs every 1 or 2 years. We act in the name of chasing growth and preventing plateau. This, in the long term, can be terrible to achieve relevant things.

You will probably make good money hopping from place to place. But, when money is no longer the motivation, you're left in the void wondering if your work has had any real impact.

Great things can only be achieved through persistence. And persistence lies in the plateau, in the comfort zone.

Messi has played soccer for 25 years. Michelangelo worked on the sistine chapel for 4 years. Jeff Bezos has worked on Amazon for 26 years. Asimov wrote more than 500 books in his lifetime.

None of the greatest minds switched jobs, projects or careers because they felt comfort. You quit your project in 1 year because you feel stagnant, because want to *"grow"* doing something different, somewhere else.

Don't be afraid of feeling comfort on your craft. That means your brain is forming neural connections that will last for life.


- opening: step out of your comfort zone is a good advice, or is it?
- not a good advice, why? millenials suffering from short-term goal setting, depression, anxiety
- why? moving too often leads to shallow results
- what you should do instead
- examples
- accept the advice but draw a line, are you really miserable today? or you just need fuel
- persist, show up, be consistent
