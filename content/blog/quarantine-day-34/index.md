# Quick update

Today I deployed my first project to [Github pages](http://dotconfig.carlosroso.com/). I'm proud! I'm so happy I sent my first newsletter ever. That was one goal I'd set for this quarantine and I got it now. It's got a 52% open rate, 11.9% clicks and we're ending the day with 143 contacts already. I'm happy just to see there are people interested in what I have to say. 

Finally, I wrote a new article in DEV.to (still in draft, readt to be sent tomorrow) and I finished a very hard feature for my contract work.

Feeling pretty solid. Quarantine doesn't feel like quarantine anymore, but just like normal life.
