# Quick update

Relaxed day but managed to practice a some creative things, and also read a lot:

- Cooked a new recipe
- Finished writing poem (3 weeks in the making)
- Starter reading a book "the art of being happy"
- Made good progress on reading "mein kampf"
- Watched 2 chapters of WWII series on Netflix

As I read more, I fall in love more and more in history. Not sure why I like it or what I could do with that knowledge, but I feel good learning about all that.
