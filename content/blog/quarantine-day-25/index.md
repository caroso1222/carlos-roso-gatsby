# Quick update

Great monday. Woke up very early, had a very nice instrospection session. Wrote a lot of pages about my goals, my personal statement, my thoughts on the current situation, my purpose. Spent like 2 hours drinking coffee, stretching, thinking and writing.

I've also used some time in the day to review resumes like [this](/resume-review/andres) or [this](/resume-review/santiago). It all started with this tweet:

It's been great spending time on each particular case, I feel like I'm learning a lot doing this exercise as well.

I finally put together a sketch on what the Cracking the Toptal Interview will look like. Getting there, launching first draft really soon.
