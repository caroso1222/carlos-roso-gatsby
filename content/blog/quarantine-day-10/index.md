# Quick update

Nice day to chill out. Did some home chores, Netflix, read, call parents, chat with brother, etc. I wrote the layout of a book on remote work I want to work on. Did my weekly planning, as usual. Can't wait to kick some ass this week.

I decided I'd read some news today just to avoid reading them tomorrow; there's nothing worse than having that dose of negativity on Monday. Everything seems to be slightly improving. Economy will still take a hard hit, but dead people and infected have been steadily showing improvements.
