# Quick update

As I said on [day 1](/quarantine-day-1), I had already given my company a 2-week notice in prep for my move to Amazon. For obvious reasons my move won't happen soon but I still left my company today.

Personal post-mortem: I can only be thankful for the time I worked there. I've grown both professionally and personally, and made some good friends in NYC. I feel like remote work was tough at times as I was the only outsider contractor. I didn't quite understand the business or even the whole tech behind the app, but I still put all my love and hard work into the product. I wish them all the luck. Thanks for everything!

Moving forward, I feel no panic for being unemployed now. I still have a small contract to keep me going but, overall, I really want to focus the next weeks in growing my online presence and helping people through my blog and my open source projects. Savings have always been a big part of me and I do have plenty to get me going.

# Data Report

## Time management

Ever since I started logging my web consumption habits, I've grown more aware of where my time was slowly draining. As a consequence, I've managed to avoid a lot of distractions through the day. In retrospective, I reckon it's always been ridiculous to watch 20 minutes of dumb YouTube videos and steal them from my sleep, time with wife, call with family, helping someone with my blog, or being productive at work.

* **Avoid news**: Yes
* **Write blog**: Yes
