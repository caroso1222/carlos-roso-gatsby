# Quick update

So happy I got to release a new site for [Notyf](https://carlosroso.com/notyf/). Got pretty anxious afterwards, checking [GitHub](https://github.com/caroso1222/notyf) and Twitter after the release. I'll need to work on that, maybe reminding myself I'm not doing any of these for the glory, but just to help. Mindlessly checking NPM installs or GitHub stars is a destructive habit. It's like being an active crypto trader again, losing life checking prices every single hour.

I keep committed to my working hours consistently: no work after 6:30pm. Making solid progress on my book too.

Even when I didn't fall prey to distractions, I'm identifying destructive patterns already like checking GitHub stars or Twitter likes. I want to remind myself every single hour I'm not doing any of these for the glory, but for the mere act of giving and helping.
