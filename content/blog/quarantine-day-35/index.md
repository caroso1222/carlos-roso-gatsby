# Quick update

I posted my weekly entry on [DEV](https://dev.to/caroso1222/this-is-how-much-you-can-really-make-in-the-top-remote-working-platforms-100k-32og). Didn't quite get as much attention as expected but, again, I remind myself I'm not doing any of this for the glory but instead to give back. I hope my audience can get something valuable out of my writings and get inspired. I also made a lot of good progress on the CTTI draft. It's going well.

Didn't feel as productive as I wanted but, heck, I'm trying my best. Won't be too hard on me.
