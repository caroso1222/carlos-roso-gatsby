# Quick update

Over two weeks forced into quarantine now and I'm still keeping mentally strong. I saw my beloved project [Notyf](https://github.com/caroso1222/notyf) hit +900 stars which sounds delusional if I were to tell that to my younger self.

I finished my contract work mid-week and I've been just focused on open source these days. It just feels so fulfilling to be able to work on whatever I want. I've been learning a ton of stuff doing this.

On a side note, I feel my health is deteriorating as I've been too sedentary these days. One of my goals was to workout everyday but I've barely done rumba. I need to commit to this more seriously.

Note for my future self: these crisis have shown me the benefits of asset diversification. I've lost some money these days as every other person on the planet. But, also, it could've gone terribly wrong if it wasn't for proper diversification.
