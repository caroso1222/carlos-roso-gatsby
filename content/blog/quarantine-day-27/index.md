# Quick update

I'm blogging a lot! I feel like practicing this everyday has made it a lot easier over time. I wrote three posts today (including this): a [technical](how-to-preview-a-readme-with-github-styles/) one and a [more career oriented](https://carlosroso.com/please-stop-doing-this-in-your-resume/) one.

I feel like communicating ideas is easier like this. I open my editor and start typing on markdown, black background. That's all about productivity.

Also, I wrote about *[implementation intention](/quarantine-day-22)* a couple days ago and found it to be very effective. I'm setting specific goals with place and time and I'm getting a lot more focus. It's leverage on the unconscious like crazy.

Can't feel happier about this quarantine. This has been an amazing time to grow on a personal level. It's like getting the best out of the worst situation.
