*"Why did you choose Amazon over Toptal?"*. I've been asked this question a lot lately, specially since [I'm a big advocate](https://carlosroso.com/this-is-what-i-did-to-ace-the-toptal-interview/) of [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/#join-only-great-devs). Leaving my nomad life behind was not an easy call, but I surely had my reasons. 

# It's mainly about family

First things first. Amazon offered me a great relocation package to move to Madrid. **The idea of living in Europe was very appealing for me and my wife — it was hard to decline**. Not only this, we Colombians can apply for the Spanish citizenship after only 2 years of residence. I love Colombia, but an European passport opens a lot more doors. 

Madrid would also be the perfect spot for my [wife's travel business](https://www.instagram.com/linaestadeviaje/). She can reach any european city on a 60€ flight; that's hard to rival.

Here's a pic of us enjoying the latest snowstorm at Madrid.

# It's also for the teammates

I'd heard that engineers at [FANGs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fang-stocks-fb-amzn.asp) were brilliant. I was curious to work with them. I don't consider myself in that league, though, but it was worth the shot. **I wanted to work with people I admired, and Amazon offered that**.

# It's mostly for my life purpose

I have a passion to mentor people and help them get cool jobs. My content online revolves around that topic and that's what I'm known for. **Working at Amazon gave me credibility to reach more people in the long term**.

# It's about a dream come true

*"I want to work for Microsoft"*, I used to tell mom when I was a child. It looked impossible at the time. I realized later in life that it was not about Microsoft; it was about working in the world's top tech companies. Amazon allowed me to fulfill that dream — I connected the dots and closed the loop.

# It's all about code

SDEs (Software Engineers) at Amazon are all considered full stack. **I was looking to get more exposure to Backend and Devops**, but my background is in Frontend. Amazon was surely the right place to get this experience.


# It's not about money

Simply put, **I'm making less than I was making at Toptal**. The cost of living in Madrid is way higher than in Bogotá — I don't have all the overhead I was used to. I can't save and invest as much as before, but I live pretty well. On the bright side, though, my Amazon's RSUs doubled in 2020. Money is ephemeral, a mere tool, not a big deal for me.

# It's not a goodbye

I live in the moment and I'm enjoying myself a lot these days. Working at Amazon is incredibly fun, but I'll always be a digital nomad by heart. I loved to work from Bali some months, then write code in the Colombian coast, and then pick a plane for another adventure.

Amazon is the best for me now and will be for the next few years. But, I know that **someday I'll be back on the road with my laptop, lost in a beach with my wife, and writing code all day long** — just like the digital nomad that I used to be.
