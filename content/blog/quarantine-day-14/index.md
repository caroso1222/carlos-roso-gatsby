# Quick update

Made really good progress on `rmind`, my new open source project. Pivoted real quick from the initial, working solution as it required some low, dark permissions in the OS. Will work with Apple Reminders directly.

I logged into Twitter to see what people are talking about in tech but, again, it was a bad idea. I found nothing interesting, it was mostly a waste of time (+60 mins). Also checked HN & DEV.to, that was a bit more productive as I got to find some cool resources.

Put 2 hours of work in my contract work from Toptal and, after that, kept working on my initiative to write a book on my learnings for remote work.

Overall, I feel it was a pretty good, productive day - full of learnings (learned about Applescript, which was totally new to me).

2 weeks in quarantine have had no significant impact on me, at least mentally. Keeping focused, busy and motivated has helped my mental sanity a lot. I keep waking up early (4:50am) - mornings are a blessing, for real.
