# Quick update

Finished reading a [new book](https://www.panamericana.com.co/inquebrantables-590624/p). Published a blog post in [dev.to](https://dev.to/caroso1222/please-stop-doing-this-in-your-resume-2mga) and a technical one in [here](/the-right-way-to-migrate-your-bash-profile-to-zsh). Also made a lot of progress on my `node-reminders` open source project which I will release soon. Worked some hours for contract work and helped wife with her upcoming business, looking good!

On top of that, I got to meditate and handwrite some pages on life, pure brain vomit. I was already doing it but now I'm following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFdR8w_R1HA) specific advice which resounded pretty well with me.

Oh, and I finally switched to [zsh](/the-right-way-to-migrate-your-bash-profile-to-zsh).

Feeling super productive and enjoying life.
