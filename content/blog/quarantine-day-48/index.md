# Quick update

I could only finish 2 out of 4 tasks this day. Felt super unproductive, not sure what happened. But no problem, I'm accepting it as it is.

I sent out my 3rd newsletter, keeping consistency over there, feeling solid. I also applied to a new top-remote platform called [Gun.io](https://www.gun.io/). I wanted to see how the process looks like to be able to write meaningful recommendations. I managed to pass the algorithm test in my first try, scoring 72nd percentile. I think that's not too good but I'm confident I can make it to the 90th percentile with practice and more tries.

Finally, I made good progress on my guide Cracking the Toptal Interview. I think I'm almost there, maybe 85-90% done. I'll keep on grinding.

In other news, the quarantine has been extended 2 more weeks as expected. I'm happy about that honestly. This has been a time like no other for me.
