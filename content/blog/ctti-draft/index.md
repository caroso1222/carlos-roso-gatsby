# English

This section will help you hone your speaking skills and prepare for the interview. Its mostly directed for those who are already familiar with the language, who con understand and decently speak English at an intermediate level. It will help you hone your speaking skills and prepare for the interview. If you think you're still new to English I recommend taking professional lessons or finding expert language advice online before taking your chance at Toptal.

## What 

The english interview is the first phase of the screening process and will assess how well you communicate in speaking English. Toptal calls this the "Language and Personality" test. I've witnessed several of this interviews myself and can confidently say the interviewers are very strict with grammatics and your ability to communicate well formed thoughts. It's not so much about fluency as it is about conveying thoughts in a good way. 

As for the personality test goes, I haven't seen candidates being rejected for this reason. Based on the description on their website, though, they say they assess "personality traits and look for candidates who are passionate and fully engaged in their work". Keep that in mind but remember the most important part of this interview is how well you can communicate in English.

If you fail this interview you'll probably be put on hold for 3-6 months, depending on how good or bad you do. Don't miss your shot and prepare.

## Why

Contrary to popular belief, this is somehow the most restrictive filter of them all. According to [Toptal's statistics](https://www.toptal.com/top-3-percent) 73.6% of the applicants fail to pass this test. This means they are very rigorous about this process. Think about it: most companies within Toptal are American or European companies. As opposed to say, CrossOver, you'll probably be part of an native inhouse team, you being the remote outsider. You need to have top communication skills and show yourself as a professional expert. This includes, of course, great verbal and written english.

Keep this in mind as a way to fuel your motivation. Even when you don't feel like studying English, think about the number of possibilities that will open up for you if you master this single skill. You're broadening your work scope from your country and language to pretty much all the world with much stronger currencies.

## How to prepare

Preparing for an interview in english is not only about practicing speaking. It doesn't either mean to put a few study hours before the interview. You need to be "living" in English: think in English, write your code and commits in English, watch YouTube English-only videos, listen to English-only podcasts, speak with yourself in English. Now, I'm no language expert, but I can tell you I've helped a dozen people, including myself, with these techniques. You need to practice all 4 areas of language to become decently fluent: reading, writing, listening and speaking.

- Reading: Avoid reading any literature (either online or physical) that's not written in English. Google everything in English. I recommend subscribing to a collection in Medium or Dev with a topic you're interested in. Read only the most upvoted as those will normally be written much better. Pick up a non-fiction book on Kindle or your bookstore and read it. Become comfortable reading content in English.

- Listening: This is critical to your success as a Toptal talent and, in general, as a remote worker for top companies. I recommend watching YouTube videos on TED talks. Put it first with subtitles, and repeat it without subtitles. You should be able to understand 80-90% of what you listen. Keep doing this, every single day, and you'll greatly improve your listening. I recommend avoiding practicing with songs: it's much harder to understand (I was told it was a good idea, I picked Eminem, it didn't work) and it doesn't depict a formal environment as a remote work setup

- Writing: Practice answering any of the sample questions on a piece of paper. See section below.

- Speaking: Personally, I find self-talking to be the most effective way to practice speaking fluency. You won't probably improve pronunciation but you will surely get better at your fluency. Read your answers outloud (from writing) to yourself. Do this over and over again. You'll see how, over the weeks, your brain form neural connections that allow you to think and speak much more fluently.

### Sample questions

Write down the answers to the following questions and memorize them. Practice them over and over again. This exercise will serve two important purposes:

1. Help you practice your writing and speaking (fluency) skills
2. Help you prepare the questions you will probably be asked in the interviews

- Tell me about yourself
- How long have you been programming?
- Why would you like to work as talent in Toptal?
- What have you heard about Toptal?
- What are the technologies you're most passionate about?
- Tell me about a time when you made a mistake and how you handled it
- What experience do you have with technology X and Y?

#### Useful resources

- If you don't have it already, you need to install [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) right now. This will help you catch any grammar mistakes in your writings.
- Use the [Hemingway Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/) to double check your writings. It'll highlight any hard-to-read sentence, wrong uses of words, etc. 

### Speaking

- 

Disclaimer: I handpicked and curated what I think are the most relevant apps to practice speaking. Having said that, I haven't used or tried any of these platforms myself.

### Daily Prep Bite

I recommend the following daily 2-hours practice routine. You can adjust it depending on what your weaknesses are:

- 00:00 - 00:30: Listen to english podcasts or watch YouTube videos in English without subtitles
- 00:30 - 01:00: Write down a full paragraph answering any of the sample questions. Paste it on Hemingway. Correct it and revisit again.
- 1:00 - 1:30: Repeat the answers to your questions outloud. Practice fluency and speak outloud to yourself.
- 1:30 - 2:00: Get yourself a 30 mins session with any of the free online apps I recommend in the previous section

## Remember

- It's ok to have an foreign accent, don't try to mimic native speakers
- Focus on conveying your ideas as best as you can
- Your interviewers will most probably not be english native speakers
- Put up your best face. [Studies suggest](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35011639-before-you-know-it) humans are inclined to favor friendly, welcoming faces.


# Coding Assessment

In this section you'll learn what the second step of the Toptal interview looks like, what kind of problems you can expect from it and how to prepare. This is not the most difficult part of the interview but you'll need a lot of preparation to get through. 

## What

The coding assessment is an online exam which generally consist of 3 algorithm problems. It's normally conducted in [Codility](https://www.codility.com/) where you'll have a 90 minutes to solve 3 problems: easy, medium and hard. This step will filter out [19% more applicants](https://www.toptal.com/top-3-percent) which will make you on the top 3.6% percentile. This means you'll be very close to the top 3% if you make it through this filter.

## Why

You may wonder what's the value in assessing how you solve algorithms when, in fact, you don't do any of that in your day job. The general conception among high tech companies is that, if you're smart to solve logical, abstract problems, then you're smart enough to pick up any language or framework. Whether you love it or hate it, it is what it is and you need to be comfortable with these type of problems. It's an inconvenience but it's yet another gate you need to open to get where you want to be. It's a means to an end.

## How to prepare

The first thing you should know is you'll need to get an absurd amount of preparation. But not any preparation - you just need the right one. It's nonsense to train 10 years for the olympics when all you wanted was to win your local competition. You will see a dozen of online services and books that offer coaching to crack the coding interviews at the big 4 (Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google). The thing is, you don't need such an in-depth preparation to ace the Toptal interview. You need the concepts, but you won't need to pass a System Design interview or even explain what's the BigO complexity of your algorithm. I've passed interviews at one of the big 4 and it looks so different (not completely) from what Toptal's coding looks like.

### Key Concepts

You should first get familiar with the next 3 concepts.

1. BigO Notation: To put it in layman terms, BigO is a standard to tell how efficient your algorithm is. It'll give an indication on how your algorithm performs in time and space. (TODO: find recommended literature)
2. Hashmaps: This is by far the most important concept you should master. I've used hashmaps to pass a lot of coding interviews. Their superpower is they can store and fetch data in O(1) time. Think of an object in JavaScript or a Hashtable in Java. I expand on this in the section Hashmaps.
3. Strings and lists: This might come off as a basic topic for you but it's mandatory that you're fluent manipulating strings and lists. Almost any problem will require you to loop over a list or strings. You don't want to be looking for syntax specific methods in the middle of an interview. Make sure you can instantly push an element at the beginning of a list, find the length of a string, reverse a list, map and reduce, and so on. Now, don't just practice the syntax. You need to be able to reason about the BigO time complexity of the algorithms. Interviewers will ask for that. Are you using .reverse? ok, what's the time cost of doing that?

### Recommended resources

- Cracking the Coding Interview: This is the bible for coding interviews. Now, I'd be irresponsible if I just name the book and not explain you how to study it. This is my advice:
  - Introduction: Read all of it but **put special emphasis on the section for BigO (section VI on my version).**
  - Data Structures: Read all of it but **put special emphasis on Arrays and Strings**. Safely skip over Stacks and Queues, you won't need it. You won't probably need Trees and Graphs either, but I want you to become familiar with recursion and how to think in a *recursive way*.
  - Concepts and Algorithms: Go over the chapters

- Codility: Definitely ...

- LeetCode
- Hackerrank
- InterviewCake

### How to study

From my experience, there's just one way to study algorithms: 

1. Take out paper and pen
2. Turn off your phone
3. Stare at the problem for 30 minutes straight. Don't look the solution just yet.
4. Start solving the problem as a human. Don't think abstract at first (see Instrospection section). 
5. Write down the worst possible solution you can think of. Only pseudocode. No edge cases, no optimization.
6. Stop and think. How do you feel about your solution? Do you intuit you can optimize?
7. Optimize. Don't code just yet. These are my tricks to optimize:
  a. Do you think you're doing unnecessary rework? are you visiting the data points a lot more than what you think?
  b. Are you missing some piece of information from the problem?
  c. Important: Can you use an auxiliar data structure, like a hash-table, to improve time performance?
8. Cover edge cases. Online assessments are all about covering edge cases because they will be tested automatically. Are you including negative numbers in your reasoning? empty strings? base cases?
9. Code! Don't write beautiful code. Online tools like Codility or the Toptal interviewers won't care if your code is beautiful or not. They will only evaluate if your algorithm works and is efficient.
10. Record your AHA! moment. I'd say this is the most important step of the preparation. After you finish your algorithm, write down somewhere else your biggest realization. Something like "hashmaps took me from O(n^2) to O(n)" or "I can create a cache variable to avoid revisiting the list".

I credit some of this workflow to the book Cracking the Coding Interview.

### Instrospection

Let's say you need to find the highest pair of numbers in a list. How do you solve this as a human? Your brain doesn't store anything in variables or even sort the list. Your brain sees the numbers and instantly know what are the top two numbers. But, is it really instant, though? Take a step back and think about it. How did you know the first number was not the highest? because you knew you had to see all the numbers. This means there's no better way to do it other than looping through all the numbers (in other words, it's O(n) at best). Now, you know there are bigger numbers than the one you're looking at. How? because your brain saw it and kept a reference as the biggest number. This could be translated into "storing the biggest in a variable". You can find the highest number, what about the second highest? What my brain did was to start all over again but ignoring the previous number. Great! we have a working algorithm now: we'll visit each number and keep reference of the highest. We remove that one from the list and loop again to find the next highest. 

Is that the best you can do? definitely not but, at least, it's a working solution. It got you unblocked. It got your neurons up and working - they're warmed now to optimize.

### Some remarks

- BigO: You need to master O(logN) or O(2^n). I recommend you to master the basics. Learn to identify O(1), O(n) and O(n^2) algorithms. Make so many exercises that these concepts just slip out of your brain with no effort.

### Sample exercises

Important: There's no value on reading the question and going straight to the answer. You'll lose your time. Put a lot of effort and try to solve the problem yourself. Try to come up, at least, with the worst possible and most inneficient algorithm. Bonus points if you manage to get the best solution.

1. Poker chips. What's the lowest number of chips you can use to make up a number?

2. A palindrome is a word that reads equally backwards and forwards. Given a list of words, find all the palindromes.

3. Lina and Carlos are getting married. They both have an invitee list. Find out if they both want to invite the exact same people. 

4. Given a mathematical operation. Find out if the brackets are placed such that the equation is valid. There are 3 types of brackets: (,[,{.
