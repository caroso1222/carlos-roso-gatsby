# English

This section will help you hone your speaking skills and prepare for the interview. Its mostly directed for those who are already familiar with the language, who con understand and decently speak English at an intermediate level. It will help you hone your speaking skills and prepare for the interview. If you think you're still new to English I recommend taking professional lessons or finding expert language advice online before taking your chance at Toptal.

## What 

The english interview is the first phase of the screening process and will assess how well you communicate in speaking English. Toptal calls this the "Language and Personality" test. I've witnessed several of this interviews myself and can confidently say the interviewers are very strict with grammatics and your ability to communicate well formed thoughts. It's not so much about fluency as it is about conveying thoughts in a good way. 

As for the personality test goes, I haven't seen candidates being rejected for this reason. Based on the description on their website, though, they say they assess "personality traits and look for candidates who are passionate and fully engaged in their work". Keep that in mind but remember the most important part of this interview is how well you can communicate in English.

If you fail this interview you'll probably be put on hold for 3-6 months, depending on how good or bad you do. Don't miss your shot and prepare.

## Why

Contrary to popular belief, this is somehow the most restrictive filter of them all. According to [Toptal's statistics](https://www.toptal.com/top-3-percent) 73.6% of the applicants fail to pass this test. This means they are very rigorous about this process. Think about it: most companies within Toptal are American or European companies. As opposed to say, CrossOver, you'll probably be part of an native inhouse team, you being the remote outsider. You need to have top communication skills and show yourself as a professional expert. This includes, of course, great verbal and written english.

Keep this in mind as a way to fuel your motivation. Even when you don't feel like studying English, think about the number of possibilities that will open up for you if you master this single skill. You're broadening your work scope from your country and language to pretty much all the world with much stronger currencies.

## How to prepare

Preparing for an interview in english is not only about practicing speaking. It doesn't either mean to put a few study hours before the interview. You need to be "living" in English: think in English, write your code and commits in English, watch YouTube English-only videos, listen to English-only podcasts, speak with yourself in English. Now, I'm no language expert, but I can tell you I've helped a dozen people, including myself, with these techniques. You need to practice all 4 areas of language to become decently fluent: reading, writing, listening and speaking.

- Reading: Avoid reading any literature (either online or physical) that's not written in English. Google everything in English. I recommend subscribing to a collection in Medium or Dev with a topic you're interested in. Read only the most upvoted as those will normally be written much better. Pick up a non-fiction book on Kindle or your bookstore and read it. Become comfortable reading content in English.

- Listening: This is critical to your success as a Toptal talent and, in general, as a remote worker for top companies. I recommend watching YouTube videos on TED talks. Put it first with subtitles, and repeat it without subtitles. You should be able to understand 80-90% of what you listen. Keep doing this, every single day, and you'll greatly improve your listening. I recommend avoiding practicing with songs: it's much harder to understand (I was told it was a good idea, I picked Eminem, it didn't work) and it doesn't depict a formal environment as a remote work setup

- Writing: Practice answering any of the sample questions on a piece of paper. See section below.

- Speaking: Personally, I find self-talking to be the most effective way to practice speaking fluency. You won't probably improve pronunciation but you will surely get better at your fluency. Read your answers outloud (from writing) to yourself. Do this over and over again. You'll see how, over the weeks, your brain form neural connections that allow you to think and speak much more fluently.

### Sample questions

Write down the answers to the following questions and memorize them. Practice them over and over again. This exercise will serve two important purposes:

1. Help you practice your writing and speaking (fluency) skills
2. Help you prepare the questions you will probably be asked in the interviews

- Tell me about yourself
- How long have you been programming?
- Why would you like to work as talent in Toptal?
- What have you heard about Toptal?
- What are the technologies you're most passionate about?
- Tell me about a time when you made a mistake and how you handled it
- What experience do you have with technology X and Y?

#### Useful resources

- If you don't have it already, you need to install [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) right now. This will help you catch any grammar mistakes in your writings.
- Use the [Hemingway Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/) to double check your writings. It'll highlight any hard-to-read sentence, wrong uses of words, etc. 

### Speaking

- 

Disclaimer: I handpicked and curated what I think are the most relevant apps to practice speaking. Having said that, I haven't used or tried any of these platforms myself.

### Daily Prep Bite

I recommend the following daily 2-hours practice routine. You can adjust it depending on what your weaknesses are:

- 00:00 - 00:30: Listen to english podcasts or watch YouTube videos in English without subtitles
- 00:30 - 01:00: Write down a full paragraph answering any of the sample questions. Paste it on Hemingway. Correct it and revisit again.
- 1:00 - 1:30: Repeat the answers to your questions outloud. Practice fluency and speak outloud to yourself.
- 1:30 - 2:00: Get yourself a 30 mins session with any of the free online apps I recommend in the previous section

## Remember

- It's ok to have an foreign accent, don't try to mimic native speakers
- Focus on conveying your ideas as best as you can
- Your interviewers will most probably not be english native speakers
- Put up your best face. [Studies suggest](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35011639-before-you-know-it) humans are inclined to favor friendly, welcoming faces.
