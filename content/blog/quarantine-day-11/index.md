# Random thoughts

I just can't get bored. There's so much to live for that I find boredom to be the antithesis of life purpose. That's what I feel today after being 11 days confined at home. Those who see this as a torture should look inside and question their life - is it that miserable that they can't live with themselves a few days? Or, perhaps, I'm just being too rude. I recognize my priviliged, though, and I recognize there's people who are really living bad times these days. For those I do feel sorry. 

# Quick update

Got out of bed at 5am with a fierce passion to start my day. Worked on open source 5 hours straight; I'm making the most out of this dream, my dream of working on open source almost full time.

I also [started writing a book today](/remote-work-book-journal). I'd been thinking about it for quite a long time. Drafted a rough sketch and showed it to my brother. Dude gave me the motivation to start right away, and that's what I did. The book draft will be [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1caLcOkSg4Bti1YHWL6QDjmpHfyd6bFsQa83WGWKzS84/edit#), in case anyone is actually reading this and caring.
