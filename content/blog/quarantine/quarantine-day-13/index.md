# Quick update

Woke up today to a blocked mind. I'm literally so full of ideas that I'm pretty much, well, "*out of ideas*". Not quite sure what to pursue and how to better spend my time. On the other side, I decided to just take some action and keep doing and shipping things.

I noticed there's no good terminal reminder for Mac, just as Slack has its `/reminder` shortcut. I spent the whole day coming up with a good solution for this problem and made it open source. I ended up with a pretty solid, working solution.

Overall, working and creating took me out from my mind-block state, and I think that's fine. I'll need to do some more fine planning and user research to see where to go next. I still think building an audience is paramount for my goals, long term.
