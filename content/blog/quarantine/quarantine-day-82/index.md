# Quick update

Today I cooked a nice dish (colombian rice with chicken) and felt the luxury to just enjoy a movie on Netflix. I also took a good amount of time writing. Today I wrote a letter to my younger self. It was a fun exercise to look back at what have changed over the last 2 decades, what got better and what got worse.

Overall the value I seek to regain is the focus and concentration (lack of distraction) I had in college. The value I still preserve (and am proud of) is the geek, nerd dude I've always had inside of me.
