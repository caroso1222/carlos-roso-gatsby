# Quick update

Today was pretty much the most productive day of the last month. I woke up 5am, I got 0 distractions, and I only visited Twitter to share something instead of scrolling through my feed. I worked on a lot of issues of Notyf. I also wrote a [blog post](/how-to-import-css-files-to-svelte/) and, at the end of the day, I designed some more logos for logo-quiz.

I ended the day having worked on hard stuff, enjoying every waking hour without any anxiety. This is what a great day looks liek for me. I'll optimize to have a lot of days like this.
