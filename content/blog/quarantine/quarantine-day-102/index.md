# Quick update

My parents came by to visit me. I had a great talk with them. We started watching Dark season 3 with my wife. I also finished the book 21 lessons for 21th century. I liked it, Yuval never dissapoints, as usual. Chilling sunday overall.

I think I'm not getting a lot of value out of list-like books (7 things, 21 things, 17 things, etc). I normally get 1 or 2 things out of each book; +7 things is just too much.
