# Quick update

Full focus on releasing [Cracking the Toptal Interview](/cracking-the-toptal-interview), my new guide to help developers get into Toptal. I put a good amount of effort in the landing page. I'm ready now to start creating more useful content as I have a way to capture traffic.

Wife told me we'll be on quarantine until April 27th. Sounds like I'll be able to produce some badass content the next few weeks.
