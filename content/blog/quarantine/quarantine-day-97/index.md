# Quick update

I went outside for the first time in the whole quarantine. It'd been 3 months without stepping a foot out of my building complex. Ran legal errands related to the sale of my place. I also wrote a new blog post: [are these lists equal](/are-these-lists-equal). I'm trying to find a compelling way of teaching algorithms - not sure if videos or written posts are the right way to go, so I'm doing some customer research.

BTW, the city looks so empty. Social distancing feels very real.
