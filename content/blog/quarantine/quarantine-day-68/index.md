# Quick update

I was supposed to work on the outline of my new book/guide. I did it all good on paper, then totally vanished into demotivation. I got paralized and overwhelmed by doubt - who would ever read/buy this? I thought...

Instead of giving up on productivity all over, I then decided to keep working on logo-quiz; turns out writing code is also good therapy, keeps me from getting deep into anxiety.

# Data Report

> *Starting today, I won't be logging any more data here (see [example](../quarantine-day-67) of previous content). I'm going to keep it simple. The only value I get from journaling is to clear my mind by brain vomiting and reflecting on the day, not so much on logging metrics. I'm going to keep it simple, to keep it consistent.*
