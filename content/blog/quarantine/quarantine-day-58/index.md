# Quick update

Kept on editing pics for my wife's IG. This is what I managed to do:

I finally, FINALLY, finished reading Mein Kampf by A. Hitler. If anyone is ever reading this, I'd definitely recommend not reading it. A summary book would be enough to understand the mind of the guy but totally don't read the +550 pages full of political and racist BS. I'm proud I was able to get through it, same as I felt when I finished Mandela's.
