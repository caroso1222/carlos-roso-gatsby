# Quick update

Laziest day ever. Watched history series (WWII) and something about oil in the middle east. I then watched this new meh series "snowpiercer". Literally took the day absolutely off. I read a letter from the book "Letters from a stoic" which resonated all day within me: "Scorn the pleasure which comes by the applause of the majority. Many men praise you; but have you any reason for being pleased with yourself, if you are a person whom the many can understand? your good qualities should face inwards" - Seneca.
