# Quick update

Great day for my open source projects. Released v3.7.0 of [Notyf](https://github.com/caroso1222/notyf). Released a stable v0.0.12 version of [rmind](https://github.com/caroso1222/rmind). Opened a PR in [PR-Memes](https://github.com/jdjuan/pr-memes/pull/1).

I just found out Notyf is getting [93k hits a month from jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/notyf). So humble and happy!

I want to keep my fridays for open source work only. It just feels so refreshing, so satisfying.
