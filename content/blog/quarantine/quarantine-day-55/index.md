# Quick update

Sent my 4th newsletter and this feels like success for me already. I'm building momentum! I've had a bunch of people unsubscribe which I don't take as bad, they're just not interested on the content which is ok, I've done the same in the past.

I'll just keep obssessed about helping and giving out.

I also wrote a new [resume review](https://carlosroso.com/resume-review/ibrahim/) which the dev totally loved.

I'm taking wednesdays to prepare insightful tweets for the week so I started writing TypeScript tips for the next 7 days. This is much better to do in batch as I have the full context in my head, I can be more productive.

Finally I wrote a new article in [Dev](https://dev.to/caroso1222/how-to-create-fancy-revealing-animations-with-these-simple-css-tricks-4gjk), most like "reposted" it from Medium.
