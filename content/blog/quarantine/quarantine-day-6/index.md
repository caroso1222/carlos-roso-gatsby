# Quick update

Today was all about contrast. I first had an amazing, productive morning. Released a new version of [Notyf](https://github.com/caroso1222/notyf), my beloved open source project.

In the afternoon, corona hit me hard - I got this cynical urge to read news. At first I just wanted to see what people are talking about on Twitter, see if I should share my tech stories as well. Then I got swamped with news. Memes, news, "expert opinions", got a lot of crap on me. I ended up spending roughly 3 hours in Twitter which I totally regret.

Transitioning from being employed full-time to working on my projects is hard for now. It's not easy to concentrate in one project and, I suppose, that kind of wandering is drifting me away from deep work. I consider myself to be disciplined but this will surely require 3x effort. I'm getting there; I'll get there.
