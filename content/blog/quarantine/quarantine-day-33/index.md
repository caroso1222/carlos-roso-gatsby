# Quick update

Great progress on my Cracking the Toptal Interview Guide. I finished the [draft](https://carlosroso.com/ctti-draft/) for the English section. I also finished a new open source project [node-dotconfig](https://github.com/caroso1222/node-dotconfig).

I was accepted to speak at Angular Bogota which will be a virtual conference. I'll be talking about Cypress. I'm reminding myself that this will be something to give back to the community. Not to show-off, just to teach what I know.

Finally, I sent the papers to get my signed up on the Spanish social security system. Amazon is so close.
