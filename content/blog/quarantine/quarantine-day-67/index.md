# Quick update

Didn't get much done. Pretty routine day, lots of distractions, zero productivity. Just managed to do a TypeScript byte image, the outline for the next algorithms book I want to write, and some progress on the logo quiz. Rest of it I was just lurking on Twitter and YouTube. Wasted day all over.
