# Quick update

Productive day. I started writing about [softer things in this blog](/the-safest-path-to-misery). I've been approached by some devs asking what it takes to succeed in tech. I have been in that situation of anxiety and so I decided to start writing about it. I like reading and writing about those things, I'll keep doing it by email too.

I also started watching the videos for my onboarding on Amazon. Soaking myself with all this culture, everything is looking good for my first day which is supposedly to be on July 20th.

Finally, I [wrote a post](https://dev.to/caroso1222/are-these-lists-equal-28oj) in DEV related to algorithms, hashmaps and time complexity. I wanted to start writing a book on that topic but I prefer not to put more things on my head for the next few months until I get more momentum in Amazon.
