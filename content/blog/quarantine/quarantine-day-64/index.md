# Quick update

I finally [released](https://twitter.com/caroso1222/status/1263852674694479872) [rmind](https://github.com/caroso1222/rmind) after 2 months of development. Feels so refreshing to finish a project, much more than starting a new one. I built a pretty cool site for it: https://carlosroso.com/rmind/.

It's a lot, lot better to finish unfinished projects than to try to start a new one. It's a boost for my confidence, I can finish what I start and I better not commit to something if I'm not all in until the end.

Other than that, I made good progress on logo quiz, I expect a few more weeks of development for this one to be ready for release.
