# Quick update

Watched movies and slept a lot with wife. Also did some journaling and reading. I recently bought "letters from a stoic" from Lucius and I'm impressed by how wise the dude was and how his thoughts apply perfectly today. This quote stayed with me all day:

> Do you ask what's the proper limit to wealth? it is, first, to have what is necessary, and, second, to have what is enough.
