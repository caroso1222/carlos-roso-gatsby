# Quick update

It was the first time **I didn't read news** since this whole COVID-19 stuff blew up. Of course, I felt the urge to do so. I resisted. I can totally feel the pain of those who're suffering, but I can't help or do much about it, sadly. I focus on my circle of influence - those ones I can help in some way or another. I keep an eye on their situation; those are relevant news for me, personally.

Not reading any news positively impacted the way I went through my day. I felt more positive, a bit more energetic, a lot more driven to help. I feel, though, I still need to catch up. I might set apart one day in the week to do so, or not. We'll see.
