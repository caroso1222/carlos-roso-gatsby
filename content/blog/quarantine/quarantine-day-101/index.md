# Quick update

After almost 3 months writing on DEV, I just hit 2 milestones: Reached 1K followers and 10K reads on 1 post. Not my most loved one but the one with more reach.

I also kept working on logo quiz. I kept [braing warming](/quarantine/quarantine-day-100) and it's working wonders. Feeling a lot more productive, improving focus and getting things done.
