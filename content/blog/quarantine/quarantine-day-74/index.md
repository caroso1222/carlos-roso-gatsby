# Quick update

First day of vacations. Totally loved it. I was able to enjoy my time writing, reading, watching personal growth videos. I also helped wife on her Instagram. I wrote today about freedom and what it means for me. Seems like freedom and happines is the end, and money is just a means for that. If freedom means something specific to me, then money should take me there. I don't need a whole lot of it to get to my sweet spot. In fact, I already have enough to be in that spot. I'll write more about this later.

I also cooked a fancy new dish today: pasta carbonara.
