# Quick update

Felt fatigue and lack of energy. Still had fever and so I just didn't wake up from bed. Had to make it twice, just to show my place to potential clients. My father in law visited us after that.

This day made me reflect on health, energy and time management from a different perspective. It felt as if I was super old. And, no surprise, that's pretty much how I'll feel once I get old. If that lack of energy will be there in the future, I'll then need to make sure my days are worth it today. It's eye opening how vitality is underrated because we don't get to experience otherwise very often. But, when desease kicks in, a little bit of meditation reveals how my energy is something to treasure.

It also let me understand how people with chronic deseases (in their blood, or brain) have it so difficult to cope up with life and they struggle a lot more to be successful. It's not that they come up with excuses, it's really that mind and body are so exhausted that it feels is nearly impossible to beat.

Sickness make me appreciate my health a lot more and make use of my time and energy the right way. I've yet another thing to be grateful for now: energy and vitality.
