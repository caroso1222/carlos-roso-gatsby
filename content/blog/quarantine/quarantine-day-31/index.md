# Quick update

I got to compose yet another song today. Spent a good amount of time on this. It's a pretty nice creative process that pushes me super hard to find inspiration somewhere else. Words are difficult to spit out with no experience. I feel like it's a good things to keep me creative and practicing my writing skills.

As usual, I did a lot of weekly planning and introspection today. I love Sundays.
