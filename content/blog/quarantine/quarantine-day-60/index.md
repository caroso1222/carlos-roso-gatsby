# Quick update

This is a very special day for me. I finally finished the Cracking the Toptal Interview guide. So proud to have been able to pull this off. I first thought about this on Apr 3 so it took me like 6 weeks from ideation to completion. It's way more than I initially expected but it was totally worth it. I wasn't full time into this either. I feel like, with full time focus, it could've taken me 3 weeks to complete. What I thought was going to be 15 pages initially turned out to be 50. I really hope this helps a lot of people.

I have a new project I want to pursue now. I'll write/record a paid mini-course with learnings for BigO complexity and algorithms. I want to bring this topic closer to devs who are not familiar with this topic in a very friendly way. It'll also be a cool experiment to find out whether I can sell something online. I hope that helps people as well.
