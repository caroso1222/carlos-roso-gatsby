# Quick update

Super productive day working on open source all day: [ngx-cool-dialogs is now called ng-popups](https://github.com/caroso1222/ng-popups). I also [wrote an article](/how-to-check-npm-package-availability/) with my findings about some moniker naming rules I wasn't aware of. I also made some progress on logo-quiz: new [PR](https://github.com/logo-quiz/logo-quiz) to jump to next logo after logo verification.
