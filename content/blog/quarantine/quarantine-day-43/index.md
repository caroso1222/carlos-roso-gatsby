# Quick update

Felt pretty unproductive but still managed to get some things done:

- [Released the first working version rmind](https://github.com/caroso1222/rmind)
- [Wrote my weekly article in Dev.to](https://dev.to/caroso1222/honest-advice-to-ace-the-hardest-remote-work-interview-at-toptal-3hej)
- Completed all my hours in my contract work

I might just need to set more focused goals to feel more productive in my days. I'm also spending too much time on Twitter, and I hate that. I watched dumb videos again and read non-sensical twitter threads.
