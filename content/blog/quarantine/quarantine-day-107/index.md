# Quick update

After [1 year and 3 months](https://github.com/logo-quiz/logo-quiz/graphs/contributors) we finally released [logoquiz.dev](https://logoquiz.dev/)!. It's something I'll take to my cookie jar. I was able to finish a project I once envisioned in my mind. I wasn't consistent but I and Edgar made it happen in the end. It's a reminder that I can finish what I start. I'm not only a starter, I'm a finisher too!

My take on React vs. Angular after this:
1. React is simple to reason about. I'd go with it for any small personal project. I would also avoid Redux at all cost.

2. Angular still feels a lot more robust for me. Reactive forms, dependency injection and view encapsulation makes it a great option for big projects. I'm much more productive with it.
