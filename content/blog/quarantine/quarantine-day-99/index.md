# Quick update

I posted a new thing in Dev: [Hashmaps like you've never seen them](https://dev.to/caroso1222/hashmaps-like-you-ve-never-seen-them-3pnh). I also made good progress on deploying the logo-quiz monorepo. It seems to be a problem with vercel, but I think it'll be possible.

I finished my day with some algorithm training, just to keep me warmed up on that topic.

I'm meditating on this tweet:
