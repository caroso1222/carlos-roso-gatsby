# Quick update

After more than 10 weeks of having started with my newsletter, I finally wrote an automation thank you email. It's a bummer it can only be targeted per audience and you have only 1 audience in the free tier. I then wrote a generic "thank you" email with all the resources. I also sent a new newsletter promoting my latest blog post. It didn't do that well, but it's something. I hope it could help someone.
