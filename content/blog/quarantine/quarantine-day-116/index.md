# Quick update

I updated my digital journal with entries from the last 2 weeks. I discovered this is a nice practice to remember everything that I've been able to achieve in this time. It also allowed me to reinforce some of the ideas I had back then and revive whatever feelings I had on those moments. 

This thought stayed with me all day: *"Change the age in which you live, and you have too much. But in every age, what is enough remains the same" - Seneca*.

I finally finished watching a historical series regarding WWII.

Oh, I also spent some time editing pics for my wife, here's one I liked.
