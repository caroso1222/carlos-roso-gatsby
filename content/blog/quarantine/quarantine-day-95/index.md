# Quick update

This was a very important day for me and my wife: we finally sold our appartment. This was a decision we made back when we were traveling and realized the financial cost of keep it while living abroad was something we were not willing to assume. It's a bittersweet feeling as we had so much fun on this place, our very first. On the other hand, having to pay a loan was a very high opportunity cost as we'd otherwise invest that money. Owning a place is very expensive but I reckon it's very fulfilling and emotionally important.

I'm letting go relatively easy as, for me, home is where my heart is - and that's not a physical place for me. My heart is with my wife, my family, myself, my freedom. What you own, owns you.

I'm so grateful for this place. I'll always remember it as an amazing time in my life.
