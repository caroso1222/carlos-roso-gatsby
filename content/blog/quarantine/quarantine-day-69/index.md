# Quick update

As weird as a day can get. I started the day all pumped, everything under control. 5:00am up and ready for a good cup of cofee and my morning meditation. I sticked to the plan. Then I started outlining on paper the post for my newsletter. On paper it looked so good - I just needed some data online. And then I logged into Twitter, to look for something, for a piece of data in a DM. I entered a black hole, the nemesis of my productivity. I then saw a very similar tweet from a much, much popular user which rendered my post pretty much useless, in my mind.

I did nothing after this. I started lurking around in TWitter, looking for nothing, lost in the void, in the black hole of time. Looking back, I'm so dumb to think my subscribers had seen this tweet before. But, most of them ahd no clue of what was going on the Twitter sphere. I'm here for them, I do everything to help and everyone can try to help.

I checked my stats, breaking my promise. I felt trap of the anxiety. I wasn't supposed to do it until like 6 months in, I didn't last even 1 month. It turns out I've only grown a few followers which was a low blow for me. But why, though? If that's the reason I'm doing this for, then I'm just the same as others. The moment I give up on me, the moment I trascend.

I'll do a follow up on this topic when I publish my transparency time tweet in a few days.
