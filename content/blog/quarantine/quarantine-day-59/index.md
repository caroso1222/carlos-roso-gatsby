# Quick update

Kept on watching a [documentary about WWII](https://www.netflix.com/co/title/70254851). Seems like the quarantine will be extended for another 2 weeks. After almost 2 months, I'm starting to feel a bit of claustrophobia already. I feel like I need some time off - I love solitude and lock down but 2 months starts to feel like a little bit too much now.
