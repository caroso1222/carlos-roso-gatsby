# Quick update

I gave my first [tech talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoT8R0pOhis) today. It was absolutely awesome. Even when I can detect a lot of things to improve, I'm forcing myself to keep the good things only. 

I had a huge amount of fun writing the slides. Even when I put like 10 hours to prepare this talk, I can't regret a minute of it. It was all pure growth for sure. What I'm mostly comfortable with is the amount of people I was able to reach. I don't know the number, but if just one or two persons learned something from me, that makes it all worth it.

It was also a scary thing to do for me. Having no experience talking to an audience, it felt super dauting to me. But, they say if you're not failing or doing one scary thing each week, you're just not playing it big enough. I want to keep doing this, it feels so rewarding to give back and teach. 

I put all the [resources here](/talks/cypress-bogota/) from my talk.
