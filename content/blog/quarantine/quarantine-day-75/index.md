# Quick update

A day full of introspection and focus. I meditated twice and had the opportunity to write about what time means for me and identify my distractions. This is what I finally came up with:

1. Twitter is not absolutely mandatory. That's just a means to an end.
2. I should spend no more than 15 mins on Instagram, just to support my wife.
3. Youtube is a huge distraction for me. I'll spend my time on Youtube like this: 10 mins meditation, 10 mins personal growth video in the morning, 10 mins historical video in the evening.
4. Uninstall Panda new tab extension
5. Check email only 10 mins at night
6. Increase daily meditation time to 20 mins
7. Blog posts are distractions too. Every read post should have its written reflection.
8. Close all tabs before turning off the laptop
9. Use Whatsapp only to communicate, not just to seek distraction

I also cooked a new cool dish: spinach cake with egg.
