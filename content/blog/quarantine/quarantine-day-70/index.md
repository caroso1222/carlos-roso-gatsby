# Quick update

Avoided a lot of distractions today. I was determined to improve my productivity by writing down the distractions, and I made it! I wrote a post I'm particularly excited about. My newsletter is ready and will be on its way tomorrow morning.

Maggiw, my dog, underwent surgery and it all went well. This ones to you, Mag, think of you from time to time. Your time on earth is evaporating, as is mine too, but the memories will last forever. For many more years together, gorda!
