# Quick update

I wanted to have a full day of reading. Apart from journaling and cooking, I managed to read for like 6 hours, and I felt good about it. This is what I'm reading:

- Tribe of Mentors, Tim Ferriss
- Can't Hurt Me. David Goggings.
- 21 lessons for 21 century. Yuval Noah Harari.

I also reflected on success, why I consider myself to be successful, how I define success and what I'm willing to strive for in my next years. Details are kept private, but overall it means **freedom** (professional, economic), stick to my values, help people with a lot of material, and have great relationships.

Main takeaway: Success, for me, should be measured inwards, not outwards.
