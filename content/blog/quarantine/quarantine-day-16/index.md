# Quick update

Used my morning to design the landing page of the guide I'm launching soon. I'm happy to able to share all my knowledge to pass the Toptal interview. The rest of the day went by pretty chilling, watching Netflix with wife and eating a lot.

Being my 3rd saturday in quarantine, I feel like I'm enjoying my time even a little bit than usual. I'm surprised on how well I'm taking all this. I'm very optimistic, and I think that's allowed me to focus on what I can influence instead of what I cannot.
