# Quick update

Had a lot of fun drawing diagrams for my next blog post. I recently discovered [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) which makes it a lot easier to draw decent looking diagrams.

Also had a financial planning call with my parents and our financial advisor. So excited for the future!
