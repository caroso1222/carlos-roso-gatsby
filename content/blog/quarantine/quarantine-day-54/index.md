# Quick update

[Wrote](https://dev.to/caroso1222/how-did-you-land-your-first-job-as-a-junior-hm9) [blog](../the-absolute-best-way-to-show-work-experience-in-your-resume) [posts](../how-to-add-colons-to-your-gatsby-post-title) all day. I'm also so close to releasing Cracking the Toptal Interview! Got a new Google Docs up and ready [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lCw1QnUjDc-mKTfIMRcTWZPTFk9KRPMjeXlK4tHwXks/edit).

I also tweeted a lot!

I don't think I had the most productive day so far, but still though, I can get through. Tomorrow will be much better. I'll try to avoid distractions as much as I can. I'll avoid reading comments (because I barely have any haha) and will focus on creating valuable content only.
