# Quick update

After getting heated over a political argument I came up to the conclusion that, for me, it's always a zero sum game and totally not worth it. Not my strenght and I'm definitely not willing to waste brain in dumb online discussions, were tweets and comments don't matter jack sh, as they only matter in the streets and when voting.

From now on, everything I post online should be *CELLing*: Creating, learning, loving, educating. Politic arguments don't fit anywhere there. I'll develop strong arguments and pick a side, but I won't necessarily share it online.
