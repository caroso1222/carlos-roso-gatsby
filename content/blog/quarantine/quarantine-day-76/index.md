# Quick update

As part of my vacation plan, I had allocated Wednesday to send the newsletter and write a post in DEV to keep my consistency flowing. Cracking the Toptal Interview is finally out and sent, I feel so proud. Finally, I posted a cool article on [DEV](https://dev.to/caroso1222/resume-pro-tip-the-absolute-best-way-to-show-your-work-experience-2o97) about tips for showing the work experience on the resume. Finally, I created a [new landing page](https://mailchi.mp/9fbe9022e6d7/career-boost) to gather emails related to career growth only, let's see how it goes.

I had a cool introspection section about fears and the things I'm most scared about. I'll keep it to myself but I'd recommend this \[written\] exercise to anyone, it's so fulfilling.
