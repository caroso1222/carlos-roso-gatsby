# Quick update

Oh weekends. Time for family and hobbies. On weekends I stress less about productivity and but I do strive for good time allocation. Today I shared a lot of time with wife and also worked on one of my hobbies: photography. I realized I should take a more pragmatic approach when it comes to editing.

I spent the whole day editing pictures so thy all follow a common color pattern. These are some results:

Side note: Been 3 weeks now in quarantine and it doesn't really feel bad. I'm spending my days doing what I love. I don't like I'm spending too much on the phone, though. I feel like I distractions should not eat my time that vastly.
