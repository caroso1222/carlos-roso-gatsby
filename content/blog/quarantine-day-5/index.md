# Quick update

Overall felt pretty good about this day. It was my first non-vacation day in years that I could spend working on my own projects. I resumed work on [Notyf](https://github.com/caroso1222/notyf) which is my beloved best open source project. I hope to release a new version tomorrow.

It's been another day without news bombing on me. I've heard by friends things are not looking good for Colombia. I keep forced into quarantine for the best of everyone.

Mental health is 100%. I'm enjoying my time at home and I'm very much looking forward to what I'll be able to produce these next few weeks.
