# First impression - 60 seconds review

- Great length. 1 page only.
- Nice Layout. Looks clean. I'd just move down the Skills section just to keep it cleaner. Move up the personal contact (github & site)
- Good cover/intro
- I want more numbers in the work experience, something that triggers me a lot more to keep reading.
- I like how succint the resume looks like
- Looks good, follows many good practices, but I'm missing something more impactful that makes me want to move forward to the interview.

# Cover

There's nothing wrong with taking ideas from my intro! you got it, feel free to keep doing it. In the first two lines, I can already tell you're a React developer with some apps already shipped worldwide - that's great. I'd leave it as is but, in case you want another approach, here's my take:

> *Frontend developer with experience building pixel-perfect apps on ReactJS. Passionate for impact, I've shipped robust React apps for +10s of thousands of users worldwide. I have experience building highly-reliable Wordpress sites (over 4 apps deployed with 20k users reach). As a backend enthusiast I've deployed a handful of NodeJS APIs on AWS and Heroku. Occassional blogger with +600 visits per year.*

That's just an idea, you need to craft it as you see fit. For me, that gives me a clear idea of the candidate and triggers me to keep on reading. See that I'm using numbers and power words to stick in the recruiters mind. It's up to you if you want to include your things about the gym and traveling. I'd personally leave those for LinkedIn only, not quite for the resume.

# Length

You're doing great keeping it to 1 page only. No matter what you do, always strive to keep this length.

# Work Experience

I recommend putting the main info in bullets. Humans love lists as they are easier to navigate and reason about. Also, put super specific data on those bullets. Put more numbers to make it more appealing to the recruiter. Don't tell me what you have done in these companies; tell me what have you achieved instead. Your experience needs to convey what you contributed rather than what you simply did. 

I see that GBH has high-profile clients, make use of this to boast about yourself a bit more. Wherever possible, try following the format "Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z" ([credits](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Gayle-Laakmann-McDowell/dp/0984782850)). Let's run through some samples:

* GBH - Software Engineer (just put all your GBH in one bullet)
  - Modernized +4 apps by moving from legacy technologies to state-of-the-art frontend frameworks.
  - Reduced onboarding time in 3x by creating React custom starters with industry's best practices.
  - Improved product delivery time in +35% by enhancing the architecture of our React apps.
  - Drastically improved the UX of 3 apps for high-profile clients (Fortune 1000)

* Castle Studio
  - Cofounder of a devshop with over a dozen customers in industries like retail, health, oil and food.
  - Helped +10 companies ship and market their products by implementing e-commerce in Magento and WordPress.


Now, that's just something I came up with very quickly, you'll need to do your homework and work it out better. I guess you get the idea now. For Castle Studio, I'd suggest to remove "with two friends and me". Just put you're a cofounder and tell what **you** did.

# Education

Great education, you're awesome. I'd just recommend changing the name to Computer Science as that's the globally renowed name for software engineering. But that's up to you.

# Skills

If you can still manage to fit this into 1 page, I'd add the small technical section with skills at the bottom and remove it from the sidebar. Put your level of proficiency. Something like this could make the trick:

  - JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS: Expert
  - Heroku, Docker, PHP: Proficient

Now, I know those 2 words are confusing. "What's better? Proficient or Expert?". Let's just think that won't matter for now. You put 3 powerful words which make me think "alright, you're familiar with these technologies and you're good at all of them, we'll evaluate that in the interview".

If you don't feel proeficient in some technology, don't worry. Say it anyways. Prepare from now to be proeficient when the interview comes. Put a lot of hours upfront and you'll get that proeficiency sooner than you think.
