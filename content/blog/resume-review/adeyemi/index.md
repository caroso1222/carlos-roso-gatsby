# First impression - 60 seconds review

- Good length, 1 page resume, excellent choice
- I got a good overview in the first 60 seconds
- 2 columns makes it hard to navigate
- A cover/summary is missing. I want you to tell me what makes you different in 3 sentences.
- Work experience is missing numbers or more relevant data.
- Overall I like it. It's succint and to the point.
- I love you don't put anything like "charismatic, process-oriented, self-learning person".

# Cover

A cover or summary at the top of the resume is a great advantage. It's a strong signal for recruiters to move forward reading your resume. It should be straight to the point. It should summarize who you are, what experience you got and a great milestone you have achieved.

I'd go with something like this for you:

> Senior Software Engineer with experience building full stack web applications. I've led development teams and acted as principal architect for both frontend and backend projects. I'm proficient with API and client side development in JavaScript, Angular and Postgres. I'm passionate about teaching and mentoring on software topics.

That's just an idea, you need to craft it as you see fit. For me, that looks a candidate I'd like to call for an interview.

**Important:** No matter what you do, keep your resume to the 1 page length. That's a winning point.

# Work Experience

You have great experience. You're good at communicating that to me. However, wherever possible, try following the format "Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z" ([credits](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Gayle-Laakmann-McDowell/dp/0984782850)). Don't tell me what you did; tell me what you accomplished. Let's run through some samples:

* Great Brand Nig Ltd
  * Expanded the feature set of the main product in 300% by rebuilding the APIs on top of REST and ExpressJS. This led to an increase of 2x in frontend development time.
  * Lead a team of 6 backend and frontend engineers in developing a full-featured dashboard for admins. I contributed as the chief architect of the whole engagement.

* Brainspace venture group
  * Helped increase the scope of the main APIs in 5x by developing 50 endpoints across 8 microservices deployed on AWS Lambda. 
  * Increased the test coverage of the core APIs from 0% to 100% by designing a testing plan and implementing utilities in Jest and Mocha. This lead to a 7x reduction in faults and regressions.

* Devcenter
  * Wrote E2E tests and achieved 100% documentation coverage for every API endpoint which resulted in much better development experience.

Now, that's just something I came up with very quickly, you'll need to do your homework and work it out better. I guess you get the idea now.

# Projects

I'd recommend not just putting the link to the projects, I want you to tell me a bit about them. Give me a reason to click.

* paginate-mongoose-data: A zero config, Node module to easily paginate mongodb data.
* LigareApp: A full stack web app built on Angular and ExpressJS to organize business logistics.

# Education

Can you put what kind of diploma you got? I'm not sure what "National Diploma" means. Is it in computer science? in engineering?

# Skills

I like the skills section. I'd just recommend to put your proficiency level on those.

* Express, Postgres, Redix: Expert
* JavaScript, TypeScript, Socket.io: Advanced
* Redis, Rabbitmq: Intermediate
