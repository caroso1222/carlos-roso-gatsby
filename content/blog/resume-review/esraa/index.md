# First impression - 60 seconds review

- Great length. 1 page only.
- I need a summary, something that catches my attention right away. I can't easily tell from the first 60 seconds whether you're passionate about full stack, front, back, machine learning, devops, etc.
- I want more numbers, something that triggers me a lot more to keep reading.
- I like how succint the resume looks like
- Beautiful layout. Nothing distracting. Big candidate name and the links are just secondary. Good job.

# Cover

As a recruiter, I read tens of resumes a day and all of the candidates know HTML, AWS, Git, Angular/React/Vue, Backend, Frontend, etc. But, what I like the most, is to see upfront how candidates shows themselves as truly unique. I don't recommend putting your technical skills right on the top as it makes you no different than the competition. Instead, put a brief summary on top and move the tech skills to the bottom. Tell me in just a few lines what are you good at and what makes you different. As a recruiter, I want to know how well you're going to fit in my team with your current expertise.

> *Full Stack Developer with experience building highly-scalable enterprise webapps worth tens of millions USD. I've modernized +10s apps from legacy systems to state-of-the-art frameworks like Angular and Ionic. I have experience shipping full stack code (Angular, Django, AWS) to +50k of users worldwide as part of fully remote teams. Passionate for community, I've mentored and delivered courses on full stack web dev to +200 of students.*

That's just an idea, you need to craft it as you see fit. For me, that gives me a clear idea of the candidate and triggers me to keep on reading. See that I'm using numbers and power words to stick in the recruiters mind. You can decide if you want to put something about your masters too. I think that makes you stand from the crowd, that could work as leverage, but it's up to you.

# Length

You're doing great keeping it to 1 page only. No matter what you do, always strive to keep this length.

# Work Experience

I personally know your work and your performance and you're much more awesome than what you make yourself look like. Even if this is not part of your personality (not part of mine either) you need to boast a bit more and show off some more numbers. Don't tell me what you have done for these companies; tell me what have you achieved instead. Your experience needs to convey what you contributed rather than what you simply did.

Wherever possible, try to follow the format "Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z" ([credits](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Gayle-Laakmann-McDowell/dp/0984782850)). Let's run through some samples:

* Acme
  - Modernized +8 apps by moving from legacy technologies to state-of-the-art frontend frameworks like Angular and Ionic.
  - Helped +20 customers evaluate ideas in record time by building fast UI prototypes in Angular. This resulted in a time-to-market reduction of 400%.
  - Increased API wiring time in 2x for +30 developers by proposing a standard structure to implement Restful APIS with Java and Swagger.

* Massive Dynamic
  - Helped more than 10 clients market their products to thousands of customers (+50k combined) by building WordPress themes with JavaScript, PHP, MySQL and AWS.
  - Improved development time in 4x by abstracting common code into WordPress plugins.

Now, that's just something I came up with very quickly, you'll need to do your homework and work it out better. I guess you get the idea now.

# Education

Great education, you're awesome. I'd leave this section as is. This already acomplishes the goal: You're telling me **"I'm different, you want me in your team, give me at least a chance to interview"**.

# Skills

If you can still manage to fit this into 1 page, I'd add the small technical section with skills at the bottom and remove it from the top. Put your level of proficiency. I'd remove 'Git', 'Scrum' and 'Agile'. If I'm reviewing your CV and you showed all those projects, I infer you know git at least and you have worked with Agile teams. Something like this:

  - JavaScript, Angular, Ionic: Expert
  - PostgreSQL, MySQL, Django, Flask: Proficient
  - AWS, Jenkins: Intermediate

Now, I know those 3 words are confusing. "What's better? Proficient or Expert?". Let's just think that won't matter for now. You put 3 powerful words which make me think "alright, you're familiar with these technologies and you're good at all of them, we'll evaluate that in the interview".

If you don't feel proeficient in some technology, don't worry. Say it anyways. Prepare from now to be proeficient when the interview comes. Put a lot of hours upfront and you'll get that proeficiency sooner than you think.
