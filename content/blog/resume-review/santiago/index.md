# First impression - 60 seconds review

- Too much info upfront. The sidebar is distracting. Recruiters want to read succinct info in just 60 seconds.
- Candidate looks smart with relevant experience
- I need more numbers and data that pushes me harder to move forward

# Cover

I recommend being more specific on what sets you apart from the crowd. Most of the candidates will have a degree. Also, all of them will be charismatic, proactive and willing to learn something new. But, what is it that sets you apart?

Try to think about this. This is the first impression you will give to your recruiter, you want to make yourself look special. You might also want to use power keywords. I'd go with something along the lines of:

> *Full Stack Engineer with experience building highly-scalable software for thousands of users. Proficient in AWS, NodeJS and Angular. Experience as a team leader and principal architect for mobile app development. Frequent speaker on Cloud Architecture workshops.*

That's just an idea, you need to craft it as you see fit. See that I completely removed your 2 lines about being an Electrical Engineer. I also got rid of the "Charismatic, proactive, ...". If you still want to keep it, move it to the end of the resume. Every word is dramatically important at the beginning.

# Length

I challenge you to make this resume 1 page only. People with less than 10 years of exp should have a 1-page resume, even more if you're applying for top-tech companies. The references section can be replaced with one line: "References available upon request". Normally, having a long resume doesn't convey you have a lot of experience, but rather you don't know how to communicate your achievements clearly.

Don't take it personal, though. I struggle with this problem myself too :/

# Work Experience

You need more specific data on those bullets. Wherever possible, try following the format "Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z" ([credits](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Gayle-Laakmann-McDowell/dp/0984782850)). Let's run through some samples:

* Ceiba Software:
  - Reduced deploy time 70% by implementing a CI/CD Jenkins pipeline which helped product managers validate features 2x faster.
  - Helped stakeholders iterate faster on new projects by developing POCs on React and NodeJS.

* ADA S.A.
  - Lead a team of 3 developers and acted as the principal architect for the development of 5 mobile apps.
  - Saved 3x in development time by leveraging hybrid frameworks for mobile development (Ionic/Angular). This helped the team ship the same features 2x faster.

* Digital Electronic Laboratory Manager
  - Trained 300 students in 3 workshops of VHDL and C++ development.

Now, that's just something I came up with very quickly, you'll need to do your homework and work it out better. I guess you get the idea now.

# Education

Couple things I'd adjust:
  - I see more than 2 bullets related to English proeficiency. I'd just skip those and say elsewhere something like "English: Advanced/Proeficient". (I, myself, can't even tell what's the difference between C1 or B2)
  - Put your bachelor's degree first, that's what I'd look for in the first place.
  - I'd avoid putting the React training in progress. It tells me you're still not ready for my project. We're all learning, though, and you told me in your experience you have built things in React. That's enough for me, I'll ask you React things in the interview if I need to check up on something specific.

# Skills

If you can still manage to fit this into 1 page, I'd add a small section with skills (and remove a lot of things from the education section). Something like:
  - Certified Scrum Developer
  - Java, Jenkins: Expert
  - AWS, JavaScript: Proeficient
  - React: Intermediate
