# Quick update

Pretty normal day. I managed to complete roughly 80% of my TODO list. I'm happy I got to review yet one more resume. It's nice to help.

Oh, and I got my residence and permit to work in Spain! It came at a totally unexpected time. I don't ask. I'm a simple man; I receive, I celebrate.
