## Mon Mar 30 2020

Started writing the draft in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1caLcOkSg4Bti1YHWL6QDjmpHfyd6bFsQa83WGWKzS84/edit#heading=h.w1mlzdqdn8sc). Wrote some paragraphs for the introduction.

Finding the right words for the right paragraph feels harder than I initially expected. Big learning journey ahead, for real.

Kickoff.

I'm officially writing a book. Don't know the name yet. I'll sum up all of what I know about remote work in this book.

**Why do I want to write this book?**
1. Help fellow devs get to where I have come to be today.
2. Teach all what I've learned about remote work.
3. Generate a passive income on the long term.

This is a first rough sketch of what I envision for my book.

Right off the bat, I plan this book to help tech workers go remote. I'll focus first in Frontend, Backend and Machine Learning developers as that's what I'm familiar with. I'll look for experts and extend the book with Product Management, Finance, etc.
