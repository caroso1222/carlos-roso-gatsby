# Quick update

I felt the impact of not waking up early. I think I have mastered the habit of waking up at 5:00am but it's still difficult sometimes. Regardless, I can now feel the shame of not doing it. Waking up at 8:30am after sleeping like 10 hours feels so bad when I realize I couldn't use my morning productively. I know what I should do to improve this: **plan my day ahead since the day before**. This will allow my brain to be ready at 5:00am - ready to rock on that routine.

In other news, I added the banner on the header to attract traffic to my new guide Cracking the Toptal Interview. I also wrote on DEV.to, hope it brings on some leads. I'm ready now to start writing more meaningful content from now on as, again, *The secret to living is giving*.
