# Quick update

My highlight for this day: read much less news than I was reading on previous days. I felt like I missed nothing, though. Family and friends over WhatsApp are the only source of reliable news I got for the moment, and I feel ok about it.

I feel like I have a lot to read, a lot to learn, a lot of ideas yet to jot down, that I can't really feel bored. If it wasn't for my wife I'd be writing code all day - but I'm thankful she's keeping my mental sanity on track.

Overall feeling good. This is just getting started.

# Data Report

## Time management

Time log (public): [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h1eGly40sAf9gdJMXhKgoB20zqzsJeECZAJvDkgM8Ik/edit#).

I put a lot of time on my Saturday to work on this blog. It was totally worth it as I'd been working in the redesign for quite a few months - finally launched.

I spent no more than 15 mins reading news on Twitter and that was enough. I learned nothing new besides reading rants against the president. Later on the day my wife told me the quarantine was extended. That's a important piece of news and I'm glad I got family keeping me up to date - that's enough for me.

Overall, I feel pretty good about this day.
